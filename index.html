<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Welcome to the world of Linux and MEPIS. If you have just booted the MEPIS Linux LiveCD, you have the opportunity to explore some of the
features of a whole new computer operating system before you decide to install it! Exploration, evaluation, comparison. . .decision. So far
you have taken the first solid step toward a better computing experience, so enjoy exploring MEPIS Linux 11!</p>
<p>
        MEPIS Linux 11 is based on Debian 6.0, codename "Squeeze".
      </p>

<br />

<h4>A Note from The Architect of MEPIS</h4>
<p>Relax—you're among friends. The MEPIS community includes tens of thousands of people like you who want to work and play on 
their computer free of blank blue screens, viruses, and spyware&mdash;while paying only a fair and modest price for all of the software they need.</p>
<p>MEPIS Linux is intended to be easy to try, easy to install, and easy to use. This guide is meant to be your roadmap for getting
started with MEPIS Linux. We show you how to boot from CD, how to test drive MEPIS Linux, how to install on your hard drive, and how to start
using MEPIS Linux as a complete replacement for your current operating system.</p>

<p>You'll find lots of helpful people at the MEPIS forum sites listed in Section 11, along with many other resources to get you started.</p>

<p>If you are a developer, you have the freedom to remaster a customized version of MEPIS Linux. We have people who have done that.
In fact one of them did such a nice job of converting MEPIS Linux into a distro to use for old computers with low processing power and RAM by
today's standards, that we invited him to become a member of the official MEPIS family, with his <strong>antiX </strong>Operating System.</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter who you are. From computer professional to first-time computer user, we have tried to make an operating system for
you. . . for free. . .for whatever you need to accomplish.</p>
<p class="r"><strong>Good luck and have fun! <br />
&mdash; Warren</strong></p>

<h1 id="section01-1"> 1.1:&nbsp; About MEPIS Linux</h1>

<p>MEPIS Linux is a ready-to-use desktop operating system for PC  computers that have Intel or AMD processors with either 32 or 64 bit architecture and for Apple computers with Intel processors. It is designed to work side-by-side with Microsoft's Windows or Apple's Mac OS X in a dual-boot configuration, or to replace your old Operating System entirely. </p>
<p>MEPIS Linux 11 comes in two different versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>MEPIS Linux 32</u> for 32-bit architecture
</li>
<li>
<u>MEPIS Linux 64</u> for 64-bit architecture
</li>
</ul>

<p>The 32-bit version will work for 64-bit architecture and may actually be better for many users, because they will have more multimedia codes.  The only advantage of 64-bit is that it is faster for a few applications and possibly more on the cutting edge of technology.</p> 
<p>For system requirements and recommendations, please <a href="index.html#section03-1">consult Section 3.1.</a></p>

<p>MEPIS LLC and MEPIS Linux were founded by industry veteran Warren Woodford in November 2002 to create a user-friendly Linux version that &ldquo;just works&rdquo; based on Debian Linux. The first release was in May 2003.  In July 2006, MEPIS transitioned with the release of 6.0 from using Debian packages to using packages and repositories from Ubuntu 6.06LTS (&ldquo;Dapper Drake&rdquo;).</p>

<p>A major upgrade (6.5) came out in April 2007, introducing for the first time 64-bit and Mactel support. A few months
later, <em>anticapitalista</em>, a member of the European MEPIS community, released his well-received <strong>antiX</strong> based on a
MEPIS Linux core and optimized for old and low-spec computers. </p>

<p>In Version 7.0, released in December, 2007, MEPIS Linux switched its base to a combination of MEPIS packaged binaries, based on Debian and Ubuntu source code, combined with a Debian Stable OS core and extra packages from Debian package pools. As the developer explains: &ldquo;By using the latest
Debian and Ubuntu source code for building user applications, we can provide the best latest versions of the applications users want the
most. And by building on top of a Debian Stable core, we can provide a release that has the stability and long life that users
want.&rdquo; The emergence of a Community Packaging Team has allowed users to remain current with application releases while retaining the signature stability.</p>

<p>
        MEPIS development continues to track Debian development. MEPIS 8.0 was released in February 2009 as "Lenny" became the new Debian Stable 5.0, in March 2010 MEPIS 8.5 was released integrating the new KDE 4.3 desktop environment. Now MEPIS 11 is released using the latest updates available from Debian Stable 6.0 "Squeeze".

<h1 id="section02-1">2.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting MEPIS</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The MEPIS Linux <a href="index.html#s12-1_livecd" class="spterm"  title="An optical disk with a booting, usable operating
system" >LiveCD (or LiveDVD) </a> or Live USB boots your computer without accessing the hard disk.  It copies a virtual filesystem into RAM that acts as the center of a temporary operating system for the computer. When you end your LiveCD session, everything about your
computer is back to the way it was, unchanged.</p> 
<p>This provides a number of benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>It enables you to run MEPIS Linux on your computer without installing it.</li>
<li>It allows you to determine whether MEPIS Linux is compatible with your hardware.</li>
<li>It helps you to get a feel for how MEPIS Linux works and to explore some of its features.</li>
<li>You can decide whether MEPIS Linux is what you want without permanently affecting your current system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Running from the LiveCD also has some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the entire system is operating from a combination of RAM and the CD, MEPIS Linux will run more slowly in a LiveCD
session than if it were installed on the hard drive. 
</li>
<li>Some unusual hardware that requires specialized drivers or custom configuration may not work in a LiveCD session where permanent 
files can't be installed. </li>
<li>Installing and removing software is not possible because MEPIS Linux runs from a read-only medium. This can be changed to some extent by running the LiveCD with the "aufs" option which allows for temporary installation of programs. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s02-1_howtoget">How to get a MEPIS LiveCD</h2>

<p>If you don't have a copy of MEPIS Linux 11 on a CD or DVD already, here are the ways to obtain a copy.</p>


<h3>Buy From MEPIS</h3>
<p>The advantages of buying your LiveCD from MEPIS include ease of setup and&mdash;with a subscription&mdash;early access to upgrades and new versions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the latest version of MEPIS Linux on CD or DVD, shipped to you.</li>
<li>Pay a subscription fee at the MEPIS Store and download directly from our FTP server.</li>
</ol>
<p>MEPIS Store: <a href="http://www.mepis.org/store"> http://www.mepis.org/store</a></p>

<h3>Free Download</h3>
<p>You can download any testing or final release versions of MEPIS Linux for free from one of the public mirror sites listed on the page linked below.
Sometimes the mirrors are a bit behind the MEPIS Subscription download site, and some mirrors get out-of-date from time to time. If you can't find
a particular version at one site, it may be available at one of the other sites. Downloading the current MEPIS ISO via bit-torrent is also an option.</p>

<p>The LiveCD you download is actually an <strong>ISO:</strong> a disk image file in the  <a href="index.html#s12-1_iso" class="spterm"
id="iso" title="A file system for CD-ROM media readable by Unix, Windows and Mac OS">ISO 9660</a> file system format. Before trying to turn
it into a Mepis LiveCD, please consult Section 2.2.</p>
<p> If you use a free version of MEPIS Linux, please consider making a donation to support further development of MEPIS Linux.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 2.2 ########################### -->

<h1 id="section02-2">2.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtaining &amp; verifying the ISO</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page provides guidance if you intend to download an <a href="index.html#s12-1_iso" class="spterm"  title="Special format file that can be converted to a CD or DVD." >ISO</a> and burn your own CD or DVD instead of buying it from the Mepis Store.</p>

<h2>Downloading MEPIS Linux</h2>

<p>Here are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p>

<ul> <!--start main list-->
<li>The first day or two after new ISO is released, a particular mirror (a web site that is an exact copy of another site) may not have it. Check other mirrors until you find the version you are looking for, then click the filename to download it. These files are usually very large, so plan to wait for some time (depending on your machine, connection and web traffic). </li>

<li>Sometimes an ISO may be incomplete. This is caused by the mirror attempting to grab the ISO before it has completely uploaded to their source site. If this happens, the ISO may be unusually small or it may give <a href="index.html#s12-1_cloop" class="spterm" id="cloop" title="failure to read a block of compressed data"> cloop errors</a> when a CD is booted. </li>

<li>If different mirrors offer ISOs of different sizes, the larger ISO is probably correct. If a mirror site has a bad ISO file, it will probably be replaced during the next automatic update at that site, usually done once per day. </li>

<li>Make sure to download the <strong>md5sum</strong>  file (see below) from the same directory as the ISO file. It will have the same filename but the extension    will be <strong>.md5sum</strong>.  Make certain that you put the <a href="index.html#s12-1_md5sum" class="spterm" id="md5sum" title="data verification tally"> MD5sum</a> file in the same directory as the ISO file. </li>

<li>If the md5sum does not match, you could try one of the following options:

<ul><!-- sublist -->
<li>Copy the ISO with a bad checksum to a download folder used by a BitTorrent program (see Section 8.1), then restart the download using a BitTorrent client program. Most BitTorrent clients will find the file already on your hard disk and patch it by downloading only the missing or damaged portions.</li>
<li>Try a different mirror site.</li>
<li>Download the ISO again.</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist -->
</ul><!--end main list-->

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s02-2_bittorrent">Downloading MEPIS Linux  via  BitTorrent</h2>
<p><a href="index.html#s12-1_bittorrent" class="spterm" title="An Internet file-sharing protocol.">BitTorrent</a> file sharing (see also <a href="index.html#section08-01"> Section 8.1</a>) provides an internet protocol for efficient mass transfer of data. It decentralizes the transfer in such a way as to utilize good bandwidth connections and to minimize strain on low-bandwith connections. An added benefit is that most, if not all, BitTorrent clients perform error checking during the download process, so there is no need to do a separate md5sum check after your download is complete. It has already been done!
</p>

<p>The MEPIS Torrent Team also maintains a seeded bit-torrent swarm of the latest MEPIS Linux ISO, registered at
LinuxTracker.org within 24 hours of its official release. Bit-torrent downloads may be somewhat slow following a major release. See MEPIS Torrent Team Project in <a href="index.html#s02-2_links">links section</a>
</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with BitTorrents, see the <a href="index.html#s02-2_links">Links and Guides</a> section for
sources of more information. </p>

<p>If you are downloading a MEPIS Linux ISO via BitTorrent, you can skip the next section about verifying the md5sum and go directly to <a href="index.html#section02-3">2.3:&nbsp;Burning the CD</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s02-2_verifying">Verifying the md5sum</h2>
<p>After you have downloaded an ISO, the next step is to check its md5sum against the official one. The md5sum is the result of a complex calculation on the contents of a file: the outcome is a unique string. It will be identical to the official md5sum if your copy is authentic. The following steps will let you verify the integrity of the downloaded ISO on any OS platform: </p>

<h3>md5sum: Windows</h3>
<p>Windows users should download a tool called md5summer (link below):</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the self-extracting <strong>.exe</strong> file. Double-click it to put 2 files in the current directory:
<strong>md5summer.exe</strong> and <strong>md5summer.md5</strong>
</li>
<li>Run <strong>md5summer.exe</strong>, respond “yes” to associate extension <strong>.md5</strong> with md5summer program.
</li>
<li>Now you can either double-click on the <strong>.md5</strong> file and the program will check the md5 sum automatically, or from inside
the md5summer program you can select the location of the <strong>.ISO</strong> and <strong>.md5</strong> files, and then click
&ldquo;verify sums&rdquo; and select the <strong>.md5</strong> file you want to check.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>md5sum: Linux</h3>

<p><u>Method 1</u>. The easiest way to check an ISO's integrity in Linux is to use K3b, the CD/DVD burner that is installed with MEPIS
Linux 8.0.
When you first load an ISO file into K3b, it will automatically
calculate and display the <a href="index.html#s12-1_md5sum" class="spterm" title="data verification tally">md5sum.</a> You can be confident the download is valid if the final five
characters match those in the md5sum file you downloaded with the ISO.</p>

<p><u>Method 2</u>.  If not using K3b, open up a console/terminal and type:</p>
<pre>
cd /directoryname
</pre>
<p>where <em>directoryname</em> indicates the location of the ISO and md5sum files (usually <strong>/dev/cdrom</strong>). Then type:</p>
<pre>
md5sum filename.iso
</pre>

<p>Be sure to replace <em>filename</em> with the actual filename (type in the first couple of letters then hit Tab and it will be filled in automatically).</p>
<p>Compare the number obtained by this calculation with the md5sum file downloaded from official site. If they are identical, your copy is
identical to the official release.</p>

<h3>md5sum: Mac</h3>

<p>Mac users need to open up a console/terminal and change into the directory with the ISO and md5sum files. Then issue this command:
</p>
<pre>
md5 -c filename.md5sum
</pre>

<p>Be sure to replace <em>filename</em> with the actual filename (type in the first couple of letters then hit Tab and it will be filled in automatically).</p>

<h1 id="section02-3">2.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a bootable medium</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Once you have successfully downloaded an ISO and verified its integrity, you are ready to create a bootable medium.  For most users, this will be a LiveCD or DVD, but netbook owners and others may need or want a Live USB.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="index.html#s02-3_livecd">Burning a LiveCD</a></li>
<li><a href="index.html#s02-3_liveusb">Creating a Live USB</a></li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
<h2 id="s02-3_livecd">Burning a LiveCD</h2>
<h3>General tips</h3>
<ol>
<li>Most important: <em>do not</em> burn the ISO onto a blank CD as if it were a data file!  An  <a href="index.html#s12-1_iso" class="spterm" title="Special format file that can be converted to a CD or DVD. ">ISO</a> is a formatted image of an entire CD. You need to choose <em>Burn disk image</em> or <em>Burn ISO</em> in the menu of your CD burning program. If you just drag and drop it into a file list and burn it as a regular file, you will <em>not</em> get a bootable LiveCD.
</li>
<li>Use the correct medium:
<ul>
<li>A good quality blank CD that specifies <em>700MB</em> or <em>80 minutes.</em> 
</li>
<li>A good quality DVD-5 with a 4.6 GB capacity.
</li>
<li>The developer of MEPIS Linux recommends blank CDs and DVDs manufactured by Taiyo Yuden as excellent quality at a reasonable price.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h3 id="s02-3_burn">Burning the ISO</h3>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>The following method describes burning with K3b, the default application in MEPIS Linux,  but you can use any burner or the command line just as
well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the ISO and select <strong>Open with >K3b</strong></li>

<li>Wait until the md5sum is calculated, then compare it with the one that you downloaded with the ISO: the md5sum  should match, otherwise it means you have a corrupted file.</li>

<li>Check <strong>verify written data</strong>. After the CD/DVD is written, K3b will read it and compare the result with the MD5 sum of the ISO.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<h4 id="s02-3_burnwindows">Windows</h4>
<p>If you already have a CD burning program installed on your computer such as Nero and EasyCD Creator (Roxio), go directly to Step 2.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install a CD or DVD Burner such as Cheetah (follow link below).</li>
<li>Put a blank medium in your drive.  Start the burner, and click <strong>Start</strong> and choose <strong>Burn ISO File</strong> (other wording may be used).  In Nero
and Roxio there is a similar command to Burn a Disk Image or ISO.
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: the program names here are used as examples only, and no endorsement or guarantee is intended.</p>

<br />
<h4 id="s02-3_burnmac">Mac</h4>
<p>You probably already have Toast (Roxio) or a similar CD/DVD burning program installed. Just follow Step 2 above.</p>

<br /><br />

<h3 id="s02-3_verify">Verify the integrity</h3>
<p>It is a good idea to verify the integrity of the burn, just as you did of the ISO (in <a href="index.html#s02-2_verifying">Section 2:2</a>). If you didn't burn your new MEPIS Linux LiveCD/DVD with a
program that can verify the data after the burn, you can check its integrity another way.</p>

<br />

<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>In terminal type:</p>

<pre>
md5sum /dev/cdrom
</pre>

<p>Depending on your system you might need to replace <strong>cdrom</strong> with <strong>cdrom1</strong> or another device name like 
<strong>hdc</strong> or <strong>scd0</strong> (/dev/cdrom is the first CD drive, /dev/cdrom1 is the second one, etc.).  Check <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> to see the device
names on your system.</p>
<p>Wait for the MD5 sum to be calculated, and compare it with the sum obtained from the download site: they should be the same.</p>

<br />

<h4 id="s02-3_verifywindows">Windows</h4>
<ol>
<li>Get the free version of the Windows application <em>IsoBuster</em> from the link below.</li>
<li>Insert CD in drive.</li>
<li>Run IsoBuster as Administrator.</li>
<li>In registration dialog, select <strong>&ldquo;Free funct. only&rdquo;</strong>.</li>
<li>In left pane, right-click on CD (top line) to get context menu, and select: <strong>MD5 Checksum file > Create MD5 Checksum >  For image file with 2048 bytes/block.</strong></li>
<li>Compare the MD5 in the <strong>.tao</strong> line of the output with that of the downloaded ISO.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: the Windows program cited here is used as an example only, no endorsement or guarantee is intended.</p>
<br />

<h4 id="s02-3_verifymac">Mac</h4>
<p>When you select to verify the data in Toast or another burner, a byte-for-byte comparison with the ISO file will be carried out to check
the CD's integrity.</p>



<h3 id="s02-3_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you verified the md5sum of the ISO before you burned, but the CD-ROM you burned is no good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try burning again at a slower speed.</li>
<li>Try another blank disk.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s02-3_liveusb">Creating a Live USB</h2>
<p>Netbooks typically lack a CD drive, so a Live USB is required for temporary use and installation.  Other users may also want a Live USB.  Once you have obtained the ISO, whether by purchase or download, you can easily create a bootable USB that works on most systems.</p>
<p>If you have an existing installtion of MEPIS, or can boot the LiveCD on a different computer, then a MEPIS application is available to you that makes the process easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>  Plug in your USB device.  It needs to remain unmounted, so ignore the Device Notifier screen that pops up.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > Settings > MEPIS System Assistant</strong>, then click on the MEPIS USB Key tab.</li>
<li>Make the appropriate selections for the USB key, key type and ISO source.</li>
<li>Click Apply.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need or want to create the Live USB from the netbook itself, you should use an alternative method:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download and install the Unetbootin Windows package from the Unetbootin home page listed below.</li>
<li>Plug in the USB stick you are going to use and reformat it to FAT32.  On Windows, use the My Computer screen, right-click your USB device in the menu and select Format, then FAT 32.</li>
<li>Start Unetbootin, and use the GUI to locate your MEPIS ISO file (or to download it) and the USB device (usually already identified for you)</li>
<li>Create the files necessary (it will take some time) on the USB device</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever method you used to create the Live USB, you will probably need to take a few steps to get your netbook to boot correctly using the USB.</p>
<ul>
<li>To boot the netbook with the USB Drive, many computers have special keys you can press during booting which allow you to choose to boot the USB drive. Typical Boot Device Menu keys are Esc, F8, F9, F10 or F12.</li> 
<li>Alternatively, You may have to go into the BIOS to change the boot device order:
<ul>
<li>Boot the netbook, and hit the required key (e.g., F2, F10 or Esc) at the beginning to get into the BIOS</li>
<li>Click on (or arrow over to) the Boot tab</li>
<li>Identify and highlight your USB device (usually, "USB HDD"), then move it to the top of the list.  Save and exit</li>
<li>If unsure or uncomfortable about changing the BIOS, ask for assistance in the Forums.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you see the GRUB screen, select the Default entry</li>
<li>For screen resolution, first try Auto Resolution</li> 
<li>If that is not right, click F3 and try setting the resolution yourself to what is approppriate for your netbook; the Acer Aspire One, for instance, requires 1024×600.</li>
<li>Finally, you can try changing the last entry on the line at the bottom of the screen to read <strong>vga=8</strong></li></ul>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 3.1 ########################### -->


<h1 id="section03-1">3.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System requirements</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following are minimum and recommended hardware requirements for installing MEPIS Linux. Keep in mind the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Minimum specifications are only what is <em>required</em> for install.  You will get poor performance from a system with minimum
specifications.
 </li>
 <li>Hard drive space directly correlates to the number of files you can store and additional programs you can install.
 </li>
 <li>More RAM will allow you to run more programs at once, and will make MEPIS Linux more responsive.
 </li>
 <li>You can expect MEPIS Linux to perform approximately as fast as a clean install of Windows XP&#174; on the same hardware. Many users report a substantial increase in speed over Win-XP, but hardware varies.
 </li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-1_minimumspecs">Minimum specifications</h2>
<p>Note that minimum specifications usually allow installation and booting, but severely restrict performance.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 3.2 ########################### -->


<h1 id="section03-2">3.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming from Windows&#174;</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you are going to install MEPIS Linux as a replacement for Microsoft Windows&#174;, it is a good idea to consolidate and back up your
files and other data currently stored in Windows. Even if you are planning to dual-boot, you should make a backup of this data in case of
unforeseen problems during the install.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-2_backingup">Backing up files</h2>
<p>Locate all of your files, such as office documents, pictures, video,
or music:</p>

<ul>
<li>Typically, most of these are located in &ldquo;My Documents&rdquo;
folder (<strong>C:\Documents and Settings\Username\My Documents</strong> in Windows 2000, XP, and Vista, or <strong>C:\My Documents</strong>
in Windows 95, 98, and ME).
</li>
<li>Search from the Windows start menu for various types of files to make sure you have found and saved them all.
</li> 
<li>Once you have located all such files, burn them to a CD or DVD, or copy them to an external device such as a USB hard drive or second computer.
</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<!--PIM (email/calendar/contacts data-->
<h2 id="s03-2_personal">Backing up email, calendar, and contact data</h2>

<p>Depending on the email or calendar program you use, your email and calendar data may not be saved in an obvious location or under an
obvious file name. Most email or scheduling applications (such as Microsoft Outlook&#174;) are able to export this data in one or
more file formats. Consult your application's help documentation to find out how to export the data.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<u>Email data</u>: The safest format for email is plain text, and most mail programs support this feature. If you are using
<em>Outlook Express,</em> your mail is stored in either a .dbx or .mbx file, either of which can be imported into Thunderbird on MEPIS Linux. Use
the Windows search feature to locate this file and copy it to your backup. <em>Outlook</em> mail should be imported first into <em>Outlook Express</em> before being exported for use in MEPIS Linux.
</li>
<li>
<u>Calendar data</u>: MEPIS Linux's calendar software supports the iCalendar and vCalendar standards, so you should export your calendar
data to this format if you wish to use it in MEPIS Linux.
</li>
<li>
<u>Contact data</u>: MEPIS Linux's addressbook software is capable of importing many addressbook formats, but the most universal are CSV
(comma separated values) or vCard.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-2_winxpcd">Using Windows CD of XP SP2 or higher to create a backup</h2>
<p>If you have a copy of the original WinXP CD (SP2 only!), insert it into your drive when you're in Windows and when  the autorunner starts
choose <strong>Perform additional tasks >Transfer Files and Settings</strong>, then <strong>Old computer</strong> to backup most of your
files and preferences for Windows-based programs to a file on your hard disk, which can then be burned to a CD or DVD for restoration later
if things go wrong.</p>
<p>NOTES: 1) The resulting file can grow to huge proportions. There is no option to split the file if it grows too big, so choose the option
to transfer only the settings and copy the remaining files you want to keep separately. 2) Do not rely on this method to backup email and
browser data for other programs than Microsoft's own.</p>

<!--Account information-->
<h2 id="s03-2_accounts">Accounts and passwords</h2>

<p>Although not usually stored in readable files that can be backed up, it's important to remember to make note of various account information
you may have saved in your computer. Your automatic log-in data for websites or services like your ISP will have to be entered in all over
again, so make sure to store off disk the information you need to access these services again. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<u>ISP login information</u> You will need at least your username and password for your internet service provider, and the phone number
to connect if you are on dial-up or ISDN. Other details might include a dial out number, dialing type (pulse or tone), and authentication
type (for dialup); IP address and subnet mask, DNS server, gateway IP address, DHCP server, VPI/VCI, MTU, Encapsulation type, or DHCP
settings (for various forms of broadband). If you are not sure what you need, consult your ISP.
</li>
<li>
<u>Wireless networking</u> You will need your passkey or passphrase, and network name.
</li>
<li>
<u>Web passwords</u> You will need your passwords to various web forums, online stores, or other secured sites.
</li>
<li>
<u>Email account details</u> You will need your username and password, and the addresses or URLs of the mail servers. You may also
need the authentication type. This information should be retrievable from the <strong>Account settings</strong> dialog of your email client.
</li>
<li>
<u>Instant messaging</u> Your username and password for your IM account(s), your &ldquo;buddy list,&rdquo; and depending on the service, the server
connection information may be necessary.
</li>
<li>
<u>Other</u> If you have a VPN connection (such as to your office), a proxy server, or other configured network service, make sure you find
out what information is necessary to reconfigure it in the event that you need to.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<!--Browser profiles / favorites-->
<h2 id="s03-2_browser">Browser favorites</h2>
<p>Web browser favorites (a.k.a. bookmarks) are often overlooked during a backup, and they are not usually stored in a conspicuous place.
Most browsers contain a utility to export your bookmarks to a file, which can then be imported into the web browser of your choice in
MEPIS Linux. Here are some export methods for common web browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<u>Internet Explorer</u> Click <strong>File > import and export</strong>, select <strong>export favorites</strong>, select the <strong>favorites</strong> folder (to
export all favorites), select <strong>export to file or address</strong> and enter a filename for the favorites.
</li>
<li>
<u>Firefox 3</u> Click <strong>Bookmarks > Organize Bookmarks</strong>, highlight the bookmark folder to backup, click <strong>Import and Backup - Export HTML...</strong>,
enter a filename for the bookmarks.</li>
<li>
<u>Opera</u> Click <strong>File > import and export</strong>, choose <strong>export Opera bookmarks</strong> (if you plan to import them into Opera)
or <strong>export bookmarks as HTML</strong> (if you plan to import them into another browser), select the location for the favorites file.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<!--Software product keys-->
<h2 id="s03-2_licenses">Software licenses</h2>

<p>Many proprietary programs for Windows are not installable without a license key or CD key. Unless you are set on doing away with Windows
permanently, make sure you have a license key for any program that requires it. If you do decide to reinstall Windows (or if dual-boot
setup goes awry), you will be unable to reinstall these programs without the key.</p>
<p>If you cannot find the paper license that came with your product, you may be able to locate it in the Windows registry, or using
keyfinder software (example link below).</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 3.3 ########################### -->

<h1 id="section03-3">3.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First look</h1>

<h2>Booting the LiveCD</h2>
<p>Insert the disk into your CD or DVD drive (or the Live USB into a port) and restart your computer.  You may need to set your system to boot from the medium first, see <a href="index.html#s03-3_troubleshooting ">Troubleshooting</a> below for details.</p>
<p>Once you have booted to the live medium, you will be presented with a menu offering various choices; these are handled by a <a class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_bootloader " title="Program that initially chooses an operating system to load.">bootloader</a> named GRUB that allows you to have several operating systems on your computer. The default boot choice should work for most  computers.</p>
<p>Make sure to note the function keys at the bottom of the screen:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>F1 &mdash; Help.  Provides important information and options:
<ul>  <!-- sublist -->

<li>MEPIS Linux Information &mdash; origin, use and restriction of software.</li>
<li>Using the Help System &mdash; navigation and function.</li>
<li>Language and Keyboard Layout Selection &mdash; F2, see below.</li>
<li>Choosing a Screen Resolution &mdash; F3, see below.</li>
<li><a href="index.html#s12-1_bootoptions" class="spterm" title="click to go to the Glossary"> Boot
Options</a> &mdash; a list and explanation of the boot options available for specific situations.</li>

</ul></li>   <!-- end sublist -->

<li>F2 &mdash; allows you to select the language/keyboard you would like to install with the OS. </li>
<li>F3 &mdash; enables you to select your particular screen resolution. </li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<p>A particularly useful boot option is <strong>R/W  filesystem</strong>, which allows software to be installed temporarily for hardware testing purposes.  Once booted into the desktop, you will be able to add software.  Note that a minimum of one gigabyte of RAM is recommended for this option.</p>

<p>When GRUB hands off the booting process to the Linux kernel, you will see a MEPIS graphical screen, called &ldquo;Splashy&rdquo;, with an expanding horizontal bar that indicates booting progress. If you hit the <strong>Ctrl-Alt-F1</strong> keys together Splashy will be disabled, and you can view a console screen and read the booting messages that echo on the screen.  (This can be made permanent after installation.)  Sometimes this can be helpful in troubleshooting boot problems.</p>

<!--logging in and looking around-->

<p>If all has gone well, you should be looking at a graphical login  screen asking for a username and password. Type in
<strong>demo</strong> for both and hit <strong>Enter</strong> to log in to MEPIS Linux.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-3_firstlook">The KDE 4 Desktop</h2>

<p>The KDE 4.3 desktop which appears for the first time in MEPIS 8.5 is very different from the KDE 3.5 one with which MEPIS users are familiar.  This section is designed to acquaint you with its basic features, liberally borrowing material from KDE.org documentation and other online resources.  For more info and customization options, follow the Wiki link at the end of this section.</p>


<h3>Plasma</h3>

<p>Plasma provides the desktop interface for KDE 4, including the application launcher (start menu), the desktop and the desktop panel.  Plasma also provides many standardized services such as artwork, presentation and script management.</p>

<p>Plasma uses a system of applets (any small application that performs one specific task, often within a larger application) that are collectively called <strong>plasmoids</strong>, but range from informative widgets (see below) to mini-applications like calculators and dictionaries. An applet may also contain another applet (known then as a containment). An important feature of Plasma is that there is no longer a distinction between panels (like the taskbar), desktop icons, and widgets; they are all created and treated the same way.</p>

<p>What is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;cashew&rdquo; is the Plasma logo you can find on the default desktop, on the upper right corner, and on the right-hand side of the panel. By right-clicking to unlock widgets and clicking on a cashew, you can access configuration options and features; you can also just right click on the desktop.</p>

<h3>Widgets</h3>

<p>A widget is a basic visual building block of the Plasma desktop (the GUI) which, combined in an application, holds all the data processed by the application as well as the available interactions with this data.  Other common names are applet or gadget. Superkaramba Themes, Apple's Dashboard, Google Gadgets, Yahoo Widgets, Vista Sidebar Widgets, Opera Widgets are all examples of other widget systems, some of which Plasma also supports. </p> 
<p>A certain number of widgets are supplied by default, and others are downloadable via the Add Widgets dialogue box.  To add a widget to the desktop or panel, first unlock the widgets if they are locked, then simply right-click anywhere, select Add Widgets..., and choose the widget from the list.  Particularly useful widgets include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Folder View: displays the contents of any folder</li>
<li>Quicklaunch: allows up to 6 applications to be available with a single click, nice on the desktop for the most used apps</li>

<li>Systen Monitor: various monitors: hard disk, network usage, temperature, etc.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you are done configuring your widgets (including the panel), don't forget to lock them by right-clicking on the desktop (or the panel, under Panel Options) and selecting that command.  This will prevent your widgets from possibly moving around or disappearing.</p>



<p>Additional widget source files can be obtained from KDE-look.org under plasmoids. Those that are not directly downloadable (as binaries from the "Add Widget" dialog) can be downloaded as source files that will need to be compiled (see Section 7.3). Compiling instructions are included in the compressed file that contains the source code.</p>


<h3>Panel</h3>

<p>By default, the panel ("Kicker" in KDE3.5) appears along the bottom of the screen, and takes up much of the width of the screen.  It is something of a one-stop shop for almost anything that you might want to access quickly.  MEPIS comes with a default panel described below, but the panel is also capable of running any docked widgets and extensions, such as child panels. </p>
<br />
<img src="grafx/M85_kicker.png" alt="Kicker" width="580" height="20" />
<br />

<p>Icon key to default panel:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Left side (icon tray), from left to right:

<ul> <!-- sublist -->
<li>Start (Start Menu) -- gives you an easy method of running installed applications</li>

<li>System Settings -- where most configuration and customization takes place</li>
<li>Default Browser (Firefox) -- top-rated tool for navigating the web</li>
<li>Email (KMail) -- excellent application for managing email</li>
<li>Package Manager (Synaptic) -- use this to upgrade the system and add new applications</li>
</ul></li>   <!-- end sublist -->

<li>Middle (here: empty) is the taskbar, used to keep track of running applications.</li>
<li>Right side (system tray), from left to right (can be expanded with arrow to show further icons):

<ul><!-- sublist -->

<li>Date and Time -- obvious, but you also can click this for a calendar</li>
</ul></li></ul> <!-- end sublist -->

<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->


<p>There are other options off the context menu when you left-click the panel's cashew on the right end and select Panel Settings:</p>  

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>The arrows on the right will adjust the maximum and minimum sizes of the panel. The left arrow indicates the starting position. </li>

<li>Screen Edge allows you to choose the location by dragging. </li>

<li>Height determines the height of the panel by clicking / dragging. The result is visible in the release of the click. </li>

<li>More Settings gives you a sub-menu of more options such as hiding, alignment, etc.</li>

</ul>

<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3>Menus</h3>

<p>You have the option of 3 menus in KDE 4:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>

<li>Classic menu (default)</li> 
<li>Kickoff: new style menu</li> 
<li>Lancelot, an automatic menu</li> 

</ul> 

<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->
<p>The first two are installed by default, and are toggled by unlocking widgets, then right-clicking the menu icon and selecting the alternative. Lancelot must be installed as a widget; once it is installed, the classic Menu can be restored by installing the widget "Application Launcher."</p>




<h3>System Settings</h3>

<p>The KDE control center is called &ldquo;System Settings,&rdquo; and is the place to go to change any settings that affect the whole KDE environment.  You can open it from the crossed tools icon in the panel, or by clicking <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings</strong>.</p>



<p>The System Settings screen is divided into two tabs, General and Advanced.  Beginning KDE 4 users should explore the General tab, which covers these areas:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->

<ul>
<li>Look &amp; Feel (Appearance, Desktop, etc.)</li>

<li>Personal (About Me, Regional &amp; Language, etc.)</li>

<li>Network &amp; Connectivity (Network Settings, Sharing, etc.)</li>

<li>Computer Administration (Date &amp; Time, Display, etc.)</li>

</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->



<h3>Krunner</h3>

<p>Krunner is tool for searching and launching files and applications. It can also be used for more generic operations such as calculator or unit converter.  To start it: 1) use the menus (Classic Menu >Run Command, at the top of Kickoff and Lancelot) 2) Press Alt+F2, 3) right-click the desktop >Run Command. The KDE 4 version performs many functions (click the question mark for help), for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application launcher<br />
Begin to type the name of the application you want to run. Krunner will grow a short list of applications based on the letters you type. You can finish typing the name, or just click the right one from the new short list.
</li>
<li>Calculator<br />
You can use Krunner as an efficient calculator. Just type the expression you want to evaluate such as <pre>32*12= or =32*12</pre> (You can put the = sign before or after the expression).  It is possible to evaluate more sophisticated expressions such as: <pre>=sqrt(4) + 32 * sin(60)</pre></li>
<li>Converter <br />
You can quickly convert measurements in Krunner by just typing in the value and unit.  For instance, if you type:
<pre>3m in ft</pre> 
you will see the result: 9.84251968503937.</li>
<li>Running BASH commands<br />
Krunner doesn't only recognize applications, but also all binaries throughout your system. You can use this ability to run bash commands such as cp, mv, etc.  To do so, start Krunner and type the commands just as you would in Konsole, for example:
<pre>cp ~/Documents/myFile ~/myFile</pre></li>
<li>Internet commands<br />
Enter any URL and the page will pop up in your default browser.</li>  

<li>Task-oriented searches<br />
Start Krunner and click on the wrench symbol >User Interface tab, then select Task Orientated >OK.  This changes Krunner into QuickSand, an alternative front end.  Just start typing to initiate a search.  QuickSand represents matches to a query as a scrolling line of icons. A completion box of matches is also shown when the matches first arrive. The list can be scrolled using the up and down arrow keys when the completion box is shown or the left and right arrow keys.</li>
</ul>


<h3>File management</h3>

<p>Dolphin is the default file manager in KDE 4. It includes several unique enhancements for the user that aren't available in Konqueror.  By focusing exclusively on file management, Dolphin avoids many of the pitfalls inherent in the Konqueror approach familiar from KDE 3.5, leading to such items as a more flexible sidebar system and a less-invasive notification system that doesn't interrupt user work flow.  Konqueror can still be used as file manager (as can other alternatives, for that matter) and in fact it shares the fileview functionality with Dolphin.</p>

<p>On the left-hand side, Dolphin's Panel provides quick access to your most often used locations, called &ldquo;Places.&rdquo; Just drag a folder to the sidebar and be able to quickly access it, from not only Dolphin itself, but also from the KickOff Places tab and the Lancelot Computer tab.  Right-click an empty space to see other options.</p>

<p>Some hints and tips to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>F4 opens up a terminal at the bottom in the current folder, while F3 gives you a split view that is handy for moving or copying files.</li>
<li>For directories containing lots of images, press the preview button in Dolphin's toolbar and get previews of the files located in the current directory. </li>
<li>To quickly move between directories, click on the breadcrumbs located right above the main view screen (e.g., <strong>Home &gt; Mail &gt; Inbox</strong>). Clicking on the arrow next to one of the breadcrumbs lets you move swiftly to different subdirectories. </li>
<li>For a side-by-side view that makes copying files between directories easy, hit the &ldquo;Split View&rdquo; button. </li>
<li>Dolphin remembers settings for a specific directory, but you can also set global defaults by clicking Settings" >Configure Dolphin.
</li></ul>
<p>For more tips and hints, as well as customization ideas, follow the link below to the Wiki.</p>

<h3 id="s03-3_activities">Activities</h3>

<p>Desktop Activities is a desktop usability concept that allows you to have multiple settings for your desktop or desktops, something not possible for the virtual desktops accessible through the Pager.  Activities allow you to specialize each desktop (AKA "activity") to whatever task you need to accomplish, and to distinguish it by selecting a different set of plasmoids/wallpapers/information for each."</p>

<p>To create a new activity, click on the Desktop upper-corner cashew >Unlock Widgets, then click on it again >Zoom Out. This causes the desktop to shrink. Now click on the green plus sign "Add Activity" and you should see a new blank desktop besides the old one. This can be repeated multiple times. Click on the + (plus sign) for the desktop you wish to use, then set up your Desktop by clicking on the wrench icon (Desktop Settings) below it; when you have finished, do not forget to lock widgets.  If you want to remove an activity later,  unlock the widgets and zoom out from your current desktop view, then select the red cross from the toolbar underneath to remove the activity.</p>  

<p>To switch quickly between the activities: create a new panel and locate it where you want it, then add the widget "Activity Bar" to the panel.  If you like, you can resize the panel to match the bar and set it to auto-hide.</p>

<h3 id="s03-3_Start_Menu">Applications</h3>
<p>There are a few programs you may want to investigate while booted to the LiveCD:</p>

<!--Testing compatibility for video, sound, and network-->
<h2 id="s03-3_test-hw">Testing hardware compatibility</h2>

<p>One of the best things about the LiveCD is that you can use it to test your hardware's compatibility with MEPIS Linux without
installing it to your hard drive. Keep in mind that in general everything runs much more slowly from the LiveCD.</p>
<p>While booted to the LiveCD, make sure you test:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Network connection (particularly wireless)</li>
<li>Video (including 3D acceleration)</li>
<li>Peripherals such as printer, camera, MP3 player, or scanner.</li>
</ul> 
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<p>Some hardware may require the installation of drivers to work correctly;  although this is usually done after a hard drive install, it is possible
to use the boot option <strong>aufs</strong> which will allow you to temporarily install a driver (or other software) to your LiveCD
session. For details, see the link under Links and Guides.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s03-3_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><u>CD won't boot</u>.  If you have checked the integrity of your ISO, make sure your computer is set to boot to the CD drive. Newer  computers often have a hotkey such as F8, F10, or F12 which will invoke  a <em>boot device menu</em> when pressed during startup. For older machines,  you may need to edit your system's boot device order in the CMOS (BIOS)  settings. Please consult your system's operating manual for the correct procedure.</p>

<p><u>LiveCD stops during boot</u>, or once booted performs  exceptionally poorly.  Try some of the Boot Options that can be found by clicking F1 on the opening screen (GRUB).  Problems with hardware, for instance, can often be overcome by entering <strong>noacpi</strong>, <strong>noapic</strong>, and/or <strong>nolapic</strong>.</p>

<p><u>Does not boot to graphical login (kdm)</u>. First, check that you have a good download and burn, as described earlier.  If that is OK, then try these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boot using the Safeboot option on the opening menu (GRUB)</li>

<li>Reboot, highlight the kernel you want to use (usually the most recent), and add at the bottom where the cursor is blinking <code>vga=normal</code> and <code>xdrvr=vesa</code></li>

<li>Try adding at the bottom <code>acpi=force</code> or <code>acpi=off</code></li>

<li>If you continue to have problems, use the MEPIS X Windows Assistant (Section 5.3.4) to copy a working configuration to your computer.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Sound not working</u>.  Here are some steps to follow if you have no sound:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a look in the mixer (KMix) settings and make sure that all the sliders are enabled.  Then on the KMix menu bar go to Settings >Configure Kmix, and make certain the "restore volumes on login" is checked</li> 
<li>With some cards it is sometimes necessary to open a terminal, become root, and type (one line at a time):
 <pre>alsaconf
alsactl store</pre>
Note: 1) alsactl is part of alsa-utils, which is not installed by default; 2) in mid-2009 '''alsaconf''' was removed from alsa-utils and is no longer available through the Debian repos.  It has been packaged by a Community Member and can be found by searching on MEPIS community forum</li>

<li>Try opening a terminal and becoming root, then typing:
<pre>dpkg-reconfigure alsa-base</pre></li>

<li>For ''snd-hda-intel'' systems try right-clicking the desktop >Run Command, and enter <pre>kdesu kwrite /etc/modprobe.d/snd-hda-intel</pre>Once that file opens, comment out the first line; if that doesn't work, try commenting out the second line instead if it is not already. Save, and then run <strong>alsaconf</strong>.</li>

<li>In the second line of that same file, try adding your specific machine model, for instance:
<pre>Options snd-hda-intel model=lenovo</pre>
or the name of your sound card, for instance
<pre>Options snd-hda-intel model=Realtek ALC888</pre>
You can get your card model by entering in a terminal:
<pre>cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#* | grep Codec</pre></li>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 3.4 ########################### -->

<h1 id="section03-4">3.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partitioning the hard drive</h1>

<!--Dual boot vs. single boot: when and what to partition, how much space-->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before starting the install, you may wish to prepare the partitions on your hard drive to install MEPIS Linux. You can do this during installation, but it is recommended that you do it <u>before</u> starting the install. Note that some older hardware may require a restart after the partition tables are edited.</p>
<h2>About partitioning</h2>
<p>To prepare the hard drive for MEPIS Linux, it is recommended that you create three partitions: one for the root of the filesystem, one for the user home directories, and one for swap (virtual memory). You do not have to create a separate home, but it makes upgrades easier and protects against problems caused by users filling up the drive.  If you choose to install to the entire disk without partitions, you can skip this next section.</p>

<h3>How big should the partitions be?</h3>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Root partition: </strong>The minimum size for the root partition is 2.5 GB, however, this size will not allow you to install many programs, and may cause difficulty doing upgrades. Depending on how many programs you wish to install, you may want to allot between 5 and 10 GB.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Home partition: </strong>The home partition is where the documents and configuration data for all users is stored. Typically, you want to make this partition as large as possible, especially if you store a lot of pictures, music, or video data.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Swap partition: </strong>The swap partition is used by the operating system to store the contents of RAM when programs ask for more RAM than the system has. As such, while swap space should be analogous to the amount of RAM in the system, it becomes less necessary the more RAM you have. A good rule of thumb is to make the swap space double the size of your RAM, but no more than 1 GB (1024 MB).
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s03-4_hdd-names">Hard drive names in MEPIS Linux</h3>
<p>Before you begin editing partitions, it is critical that you understand how MEPIS Linux (and other Linux operating systems) refers
to hard drives and hard drive partitions.</p>

<p>Unlike Windows, which assigns a &ldquo;drive letter&rdquo; to each of your hard drive partitions, MEPIS Linux assigns a short
<strong>device name</strong> to each hard drive or storage device on a system.  The device names always start with <strong>sd</strong> plus
a single letter.  For instance, the first drive on your system will be <strong>sda</strong>, the second <strong>sdb</strong>, etc. Within each drive every partition is referred to as a number appended to the device name. </p>
<p> Thus, for instance, &ldquo;sda1&rdquo; would be the first partition on the first hard drive, while &ldquo;sdb3&rdquo; would be the third
partition on the second drive.  It is important to understand the difference between referring to an entire device
(such as <strong>sda</strong>) and a partition on the device (such as <strong>sda1</strong>). </p>
<br />


<!--Prepping Windows for NTFS resizing-->
<h2 id="s03-4_ntfs">Resizing an NTFS partition</h2>
<p>Resizing an <a href="index.html#s12-1_ntfs" class="spterm"  title="click to go to the Glossary">  NTFS</a> (Windows NT File System) partition with KDE Partition Manager is generally a painless and simple procedure. However there are some small risks, particularly if your hard drive is old or very full. You can mitigate these risks by taking the following steps on your Windows installation (consult your online Windows help (F1) if you are unsure how to perform any of these tasks):</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Back up all your data, if you haven't already!</li>
<li>Run the disk cleanup wizard to delete unnecessary files. You may also want to run a third party cleanup tool (example link below). Make sure there is enough free space on the drive so that it will still have several gigabytes free after you resize it.
</li>
<li>Check the filesystem for errors using chkdsk.exe or scandisk.exe (depending on your version of Windows).</li>
<li>Defragment your hard drive.</li>
<li><u>If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7</u>: Use the &ldquo;Disk Management&rdquo; tool in Windows to resize the drive. Be warned: this tool does not respect standard hard disk partitioning conventions and it will often leave a small unusable portion of the disk at the end point of the shrunken partition that will show up in the standards-based partitioning tools like those provided with MEPIS Linux.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h5 id="s03-4_steps">Resizing steps:</h5>
<!--Using -->
<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->

<ol>
<li> From the LiveCD click <strong>Start Menu > System > KDE Partition Manager (Partition Editor)</strong>.</li>
<li>In KDE Partition Manager select the drive then select the partition. Note that you can only resize the partition where MEPIS Linux itself is installed by using the LiveCD.</li>
<li>Right-click on the partition and select &ldquo;Resize&rdquo;. Choose the new size of the partition. The free space that will remain will be used for MEPIS Linux installation; make sure the &ldquo;free space after&rdquo; resizing is larger than the minimum required size for your version of MEPIS Linux (see <a href="index.html#section03-1">minimum/recommended specifications</a>). Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;</li>
<li>Right-click on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; partition and select &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Select Partition Type: linux-swap. Enter the size you have chosen. Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Right-click on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; partition and select &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Unless you know what you are doing, select Ext3 and allot the amount of space you have chosen for root. Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Repeat the last steps to create a partition for home.</li>
<li>Click on the disk icon or go to <strong>File > Commit</strong>, respond &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the dialog. KDE Partition Manager will now
repartition your drive; at the end you should get a message that the operation was completed successfully. </li>
<li><strong>Very Important!</strong> Note down the partition numbers/names as displayed in the new partition layout (e.g., sda3). You will need this information when choosing what partition number/name to install Mepis on, and to ensure that you do not overwrite your Windows partition!</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-4_other">Other partitioning considerations</h2>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>
A single hard drive can have only 4 primary partitions. If you need to have more than 4 partitions on the disk, you need to create an <strong>extended partition</strong>, which you can then divide into 15 or fewer <strong>logical partitions.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Many home computers are sold with a &ldquo;diagnostic partition&rdquo; and &ldquo;restore partition&rdquo;, in addition to the factory OS
install. If you see multiple partitions showing up in KDE Partition Manager that you were not aware of, they are probably these.
</li>
<li>Some computers need to be rebooted after changing the partitions before they can access the new partitions. If you are having trouble installing or formatting your new partitions, restart the computer and try again.
</li>
<li>After resizing an NTFS partition and booting back to Windows, Windows will claim the drive is &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and do a disk check. This is normal, and no data corruption should result from the resize. Allow the check to run its course, and your drive should be fine after that.

<h1 id="section04-0">4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation</h1>

<h2>4.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>The motto of MEPIS Linux is &ldquo;Easy to try, easy to install, easy to use.&rdquo; And indeed, you will most likely discover that MEPIS Linux is the easiest and friendliest operating system installation you have ever used.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.1  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section04-1">4.1 Detailed steps</h1>
<p>At this point, you should have done the following:</p>
<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Downloaded the MEPIS Linux ISO and burned it to a CD (see <a href="index.html#section02-2">Section 2.2</a>).</li>
<li>Backed up your important data (see <a href="index.html#section03-2">Section 3.2</a>).</li>
<li>Freed the necessary space on your hard drive, if needed (see <a href="index.html#section03-4">Section 3.4</a>).</li>
<li>Created partitions for MEPIS Linux (see <a href="index.html#section03-4">Section 3.4</a>).  Optionally, you can do this during the
installation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<p>Now all you will need to do is run through the simple installation wizard and then restart your machine. Depending on your configuration, this will probably take less than 15 minutes, and could even be as little as 5 minutes!</p>
<p>These instructions should cover most installation scenarios; for more details or for unusual circumstances, see the left panel of the MEPIS installer as you go through, or check the links below.</p>

<h2 id="s04-1_begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>In most cases the MEPIS Linux installation process should go fine.  But sometimes things can go wrong (because of user error, for instance) and potentially wipe out the contents of your hard drive. <strong>If you are not prepared for that possibility, stop now and protect your data</strong>.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s04-1_installer">Launch the Installer</h2>
<p>Boot to the LiveCD (see Section 3.3).  Once at the desktop, click the MEPIS Install icon and enter <strong>root</strong> when prompted for a password.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_license">License and Terms  </h3>
<p>Read through the license and terms of use.  Check <em>I agree to the Terms</em> and click <strong>Next.</strong></p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg1">Page 1</h3>
<p>Select the disk on which you wish to install MEPIS Linux. Refer to <a href="index.html#section03-4">Section 3.4</a> if you are not sure what the Linux hard drive names mean. What you do next is determined by how you wish to set up your computer:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Auto-install using entire disk</strong>
<br />
Select this option if you plan to use the entire hard drive for MEPIS Linux and you aren't particular about how the partitions are set up. If you select this, the installer will create a root, swap, and home partition for you using the entire drive. You can optionally specify an amount of space to leave unused, if you plan to create more partitions afterward. <strong>Make sure you understand that selecting this option will delete any existing partitions and data</strong>.  Only choose this if you are not going to keep anything on the selected hard drive.
</li>
<li><strong>Custom install on existing partitions</strong>
<br />
If you are installing MEPIS Linux to a dual-boot with another operating system, or you wish to define the sizes of your partitions manually, you need to select this option. If you have not previously set up your partitions (see Section 3.4), you may click the button to run KDE Partition Manager at this point and create them. You <em>must</em> have your partitions created before moving on if you want to select this option.
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s04-1_pg2">Page 2</h3>
<p>If you chose <strong>Auto-install using entire disk</strong> on the last page, you will not see this page.  Skip to the next step.  </p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Page 2(a):&nbsp;&nbsp;  </strong>If you chose <strong>custom install on existing partitions,</strong> you will now be prompted to select the partitions to install MEPIS Linux. Specify the <strong>root</strong> and <strong>swap</strong> partitions you have set up previously; if you have set up a separate partition for your <a href="index.html#s12-1_home-dir" class="spterm" title="Click to go to glossary entry." > home directory,</a>  specify it here, otherwise set <strong>home</strong> to &ldquo;root&rdquo;.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 2(b):&nbsp;&nbsp;  </strong> Check &ldquo;Preserve data in /home&rdquo; if you are doing an upgrade
and already have data in an existing home partition; note that this option is not recommended. Select <strong>Check for badblocks</strong> if you want to do a scan for physical defects on the harddrive during formatting. This <em>is</em> recommended. Finally, you can optionally select the type of filesystem you want to use on the hard drive. If you don't know what to choose here, the default <strong>ext3</strong> is recommended.  In MEPIS Linux for the first time, ext4 is available (see Section 10.1).
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s04-1_pg3">Page 3</h3>
<p>MEPIS Linux will now begin the install. You will be prompted to
confirm the formatting of each partition (or the entire disk). Answer &ldquo;YES&rdquo; to each, then
sit back, relax and read the informational messages while MEPIS Linux is copied to your hard drive. </p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg4">Page 4</h3>
<p>You now need to install GRUB, the bootloader (see <a href="index.html#section05-4"> Section 5.4</a>). In most cases, you should go with the
default setting (MBR).  Select <strong>root</strong> if you are an expert, as you will need to manually edit the existing boot loader to boot to MEPIS Linux, either directly or by <a
href="index.html#s12-1_chainloading" class="spterm" title="Click to go to Glossary entry."> chainloading</a>. </p>

<p>If you are installing to MBR and have more than one hard drive, make sure you have the correct drive selected for &ldquo;system boot
disk.&rdquo; Usually this will be the first drive on the system (sda). </p>

<p>NOTE: The <strong>initrd</strong> option refers to an <em>initial RAM drive,</em> a virtual hard drive created in the system's memory that
allows the kernel to load special driver modules required to read the boot device (hard drive). It is the default setting.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg5">Page 5</h3>
<p>On this page you can enable or disable a few common services:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li><strong>ppp</strong> is required for dialup internet connections, ADSL connections, and PPTP support. Note that if you have DSL but
connect your computers through a router, you do not need PPP.
</li>
<li><strong>bluez</strong> is for bluetooth device support.  If you do not have bluetooth capabilities on your computer, you may safely
disable bluez.
</li>
<li><strong>cupsys</strong> is the Common Unix Printing System. You
should install cupsys if you intend to print from this machine or use
it as a print server.
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s04-1_pg6">Page 6</h3>
<p>Here is where you specify your computer's name and domain. On most home networks the domain does not matter; however, if you are
on a large corporate network, or your network has its own internal DNS server, you can set your domain name here.</p>

<p>You can also enable or disable the Samba server and configure the  Samba workgroup (see <a href="index.html#section05-6-3">Section 5.6.3</a>). If you have other computers running Windows on your network and wish to share files or printers to them, enable this setting.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg7">Page 7</h3>
<p>If you are in the United States, the default locale settings should be fine for you. If you are outside the USA, select the keyboard and locale settings appropriate to your language and country.</p>

<p>You can also indicate here whether your hardware clock is set to GMT (a.k.a. UTC). If you are dual-booting with Microsoft Windows, you will want to leave this unselected. If you are installing on Apple hardware or if this computer will only run Linux, check this box.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg8">Page 8</h3>
<p>On this page you will set up a username and password for the default user, and a password for the root (administrative) user. </p>
<p>Usernames:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Are case sensitive.  For simplicity's sake, use all lower case.</li>
<li>Should not contain spaces or symbols</li>
<li>Can also be created using MEPIS User Assistant (see <a href="index.html#section05-3-3">section 5.3.3</a>) after installation, if you need more users.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<p>Passwords:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Are case-sensitive.</li>
<li>Should be secure, especially the root password. They should be at least six characters, contain a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols, and should not be based on a dictionary word.</li>
<li>Should not be forgotten. You'll need to have root password to do any administrative task on the computer, such as installing software or configuring hardware.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3>Finished!</h3>
<p>This concludes the setup. Click <strong>Finish,</strong> and you will be prompted as to whether or not you want to reboot. Click
<strong>YES.</strong> The LiveCD will shut down and the disk will be ejected. You can now boot into MEPIS Linux!</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.2  ########################### -->


<h1 id="section04-2">4.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special situations</h1>


<h2 id="s04-2_older">Older hardware</h2>
<p>If you are trying to install MEPIS Linux on older hardware, and the LiveCD is running very slowly, try the following:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't load KDE</strong>: At the login menu, go to the <em>Session</em> menu and select <strong>failsafe</strong>,
then log in as root (password is <em>root</em>). You will find yourself at a command prompt. Enter the command <strong>minstall</strong>. This will launch the installation wizard, and you can proceed with section 4.1 from step 2.</li>

<li><strong>Install using a different machine</strong>: Remove the hard drive from your old computer, and insert it into a faster machine. Run the
MEPIS Linux install as described in section 4.1. After installation is complete, remove the hard drive and put it back in the old machine.
Because MEPIS Linux redetects all hardware on every boot (rather than once during the installation), you should have little or no problem.</li>

<li><strong>Try antiX</strong>: If your hardware is very old (near or below the minimum requirements), you may have better results from antiX. This
community remaster of MEPIS Linux was designed for old machines.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->


<h2>Without a CD</h2>

<p>Even if your computer does not have a bootable CD or DVD drive, you can install MEPIS Linux.</p>

<p>For instance, if your system supports booting from a USB drive (Apple does not) you should be able to boot to the flash drive
and proceed with the install normally. On a second computer, boot to the LiveCD and create a bootable MEPIS Linux flash drive using the MEPIS System Assistant. Most users report this method is actually much faster than a traditional CD installation.  Check the MEPIS Wiki for details and current status.</p>

<p>For other alternative boot methods, see this <a href="index.html#s04-3_links"> Links and Guides</a> subsection.</p>

<h1 id="section04-3">4.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>Lockups during installation</h2>
<p>If MEPIS Linux is locking up during installation, it is usually due to a problem with faulty computer hardware, or a bad CD. Refer to <a href="index.html#s02-3_verify">Section 2.3</a> for details on verifying your MEPIS Linux CD.</p>

<p>If you have determined that the CD is not the problem, it may be due to faulty RAM, a faulty hard drive, or some other piece of faulty or incompatible hardware.</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Refer to the Links and Guides at the bottom of the page  for details on testing your RAM and Hard drive for physical defects.</li>

<li>Shut down your computer and remove any non-essential hardware, then attempt the installation again. Non-essential hardware may include
USB, serial, and parallel-port devices; removable PCI, AGP, PCIE, modem slot, or ISA expansion cards (excluding video, if you do not have
onboard video); SCSI devices (unless you are installing to or from one); IDE or SATA devices that you are not installing to or from;
joysticks, MIDI cables, audio cables, and any other external multimedia devices.</li>

<li>Add one of the Boot Options space at the bottom where the cursor is blinking (see <a href="index.html#section03-3">Section 3.3</a>).</li>

<li>Systems often lock up due to overheating. Open the computer's case and ensure that all the system's fans are running when it is turned on. If your BIOS supports it, check the CPU and Motherboard temperatures and compare them to the temperature specifications for your system.</li>

<li>Your CD drive may be having problems. If your system supports it, create a MEPIS Linux bootable USB flash drive and install from
that.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h2>Installed MEPIS Linux does not boot</h2>
<p>After a reboot, it sometimes happens that your computer reports that no operating system or bootable disk was found. Usually, this means
that either you failed to install GRUB, or you failed to mark at least one partition bootable (a.k.a. &ldquo;active&rdquo;) during custom
partitioning of the hard drive.</p>
<p>To fix this, try the following:</p>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Boot to the LiveCD, log in as <strong>demo</strong></li>

<li>Launch KDE Partition Manager, and select the drive on which you installed MEPIS Linux</li>

<li>The partition on which you installed MEPIS Linux should say &ldquo;Active&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Status&rdquo; field. If it does not,
right-click it and select <strong>set active.</strong> Then click <strong>Commit.</strong></li>

<li>If that was not the problem, launch <a href="index.html#section05-3-2">the MEPIS System Assistant </a> and run a GRUB repair. If you did not previously install GRUB to the MBR, this might be something to try.</li>

<li>If this still does not fix it, you may have a faulty hard drive. Use the <a href="index.html#section05-3-2">the MEPIS System Assistant </a>  (from the LiveCD) to check your MEPIS Linux partition for bad blocks.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.4  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section04-4">4.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple Intel computers</h1>


<p>MEPIS Linux is compatible with Apple Intel computers: those based on Intel x86 CPUs, with the exception of some small details.  Intel Core 2 or Xenon-based Apple computers can run 64-bit MEPIS, but all Intel-Core-based Apple computers can run 32-bit MEPIS.</p>

<p>MEPIS Linux has a utility for preparing your Apple bootable hard drive for OS X so that you can install MEPIS Linux painlessly. This <em>MEPIS Assistant</em> is compatible with OS X Tiger and Leopard. There is a README file in the in the LiveCD OSX directory  with more information.</p>
<p>Instructions for installation:</p>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Put the MEPIS Linux media into an appropriate drive, and use the Finder to navigate to the OS X folder of the CD or
DVD.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the MEPIS Linux Assistant for OS X (<strong>SimplyMEPIS Assistant.app.zip</strong>) to the OS X desktop.</li>
<li>Unzip it, then launch the SimplyMEPIS  Assistant.app and follow the instructions.</li>
<li>When prompted, reboot into the CD or DVD and install MEPIS Linux following the directions in <a href="index.html#section04-1">Section 4.1</a>.</li>
<li>Install MEPIS Linux on the partition you created with the MEPIS Linux 8.5 Assistant for OS X.</li>
<li>After installing MEPIS Linux, return to the Assistant in OS X to enable dual booting.
</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->

<p>NOTE: the Installer disables options that would be likely to damage your OS X System Drive.  <strong>Do not try to use <em>Parted,
KDE Partition Manager,</em> or <em>QTParted</em></strong> to do anything on an OS X System Drive. If used, <em>parted</em> will probably destroy the OS X installation and make the disk unbootable.</p>


<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />





<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.5  ########################### -->


<h1 id="section04-5">4.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstalling MEPIS Linux</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In many instances, removing MEPIS is no different from that of any other operating system.  But when you need to remove MEPIS from a dual boot system and restore the original single partition structure, the procedure is somewhat more complicated.</p>
<br /><br />

<h2 id="s04-5_remove">Remove the Linux partition</h2>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Boot up the LiveCD and log in as your regular user.
</li>
<li>Click Start Menu > System > KDE Partition Manager (Partition Editor), and supply the root password.
</li>
<li>In the upper right corner of the screen, select the hard drive (you will see a Windows partition when you have the right one).
</li>
<li>Right-click the MEPIS Linux drive or drives, and select delete from the menu. If delete is not there, choose "resize" and shrink it to zero.
</li>
<li>When all Linux drives are done, then resize the Windows drive to the maximum.
</li>
<li>Reboot without the CD into Windows, which will probably tell you it has to check the drive.
</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->
<br /><br />

<h2 id="s04-5_mbr">Restore the MBR</h2>

<p>If GRUB (the boot loader used by MEPIS Linux) was installed on the <a href="index.html#s12-1_mbr" class="spterm" title="Click
to go to Glossary entry."> MBR </a> (master boot record at the very beginning of a hard drive), you will probably also have to reinstall the Windows bootloader in one of the following ways:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>

<li>
For XP, you do that by booting the Windows install CD and picking the repair option. Once you get to a DOS screen you can issue the command:
<pre>fixmbr</pre>
</li>

<li>If you do not have the Windows CD, you can repair the MBR with third-party software such as Active@ Partition Recovery for DOS (link below).  You may need to have backed up the MBR.
</li>

<li>Alternatively, you can boot into the Windows Recovery console on the hard drive, and run fixmbr from there.  For booting, use the MEPIS Live CD and run grub from the command line.  Then enter the following commands from the grub prompt:
<pre>
root (hd0,0)
chainloader +1
boot
</pre>
NOTE: (hd0,0) may have to be changed, depending on which disk/partition Windows is installed.
<br />&nbsp;
</li>

<li>If the Windows Recovery console isn't available by default, you can create it in Windows by finding WINNT32.EXE and running this from the Windows command line and rebooting afterwards:
<pre>C:\I386\WINNT32.EXE /cmdcons</pre>
NOTE: The I386 folder may appear in different places on different systems.
<br />&nbsp;
</li> 
 
<li>Alternatively, the MEPIS Live CD has a built-in application, ms-sys, to restore the Windows 2000/XP/2003 MBR on the hard disk.  Run this command from the Konsole (terminal) as root:
<pre> ms-sys -m /dev/sda</pre>
NOTE: if the boot disk is different than sda, then change the name accordingly.
<br />&nbsp;
</li>

<li>For Windows Vista, follow the link below on how to use the Bootrec.exe tool.
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section05-2-1">5.2.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to set up a camera </h1>

<p>In most cases MEPIS Linux will add a camera automatically:</p>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Switch on your camera in 'play' mode and connect it to your computer.</li>
<li>Many cameras will be recognized by the Device Notifier to the right of the Start Menu icon, which will send up a notification that a new storage device has been connected, and it will carry the name of your camera.  Click on that device, and then select "Open with Dolphin" from the items on the list.</li>
<li>Alternatively, click <strong>Start Menu > Graphics > Gwenview (Image Viewer)</strong>, and you will see your camera listed under Places.</li>
<li>IF you still have problems, install Digikam from the repos.  It will likely recognize your camera and allow you to import images.</li>
<li>Some brands (Kodak, for example) or models sometimes present particular problems, and may require a manual edit of the rules governing how plug-in devices are handled.  See the Wiki link below for Kodak cameras on how to do that.</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->

<p>If your camera uses a multimedia card for storage, as many do, you may find it easiest to use a card reader (cheap if not built in) to connect to your USB port.  Under MEPIS Linux, it will usually show up as an additional media device on your desktop, and you can read and write to it as if it were a
hard or floppy disk.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 class="05-2-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Make sure your user-id appears in the camera group (create it if necessary) using KUser.</li>
<li>If your camera does not appear, check to see if it is on the USB device list linked below.
</li>
<li>Google for the keywords "gphoto2 YourCameraMake YourCameraModel". Look for a changelog that includes your model. Check the version of the changelog and compare it to the output of typing this into a terminal:
<pre>gphoto2 --version</pre>
You may need a new version of <strong>gphoto2</strong> if the older version
of the program does not recognize the camera.  See whether one is available from MEPIS Repositories or search the MEPIS Community Forum (see Links &amp; Guides).  See <a href="index.html#s07-3_source">Section 7.3: Other install methods: source code</a> if you need to compile it yourself.

<p>In most cases, the monitor will be recognized by MEPIS Linux when the LiveCD is booted, and the appropriate driver will be included when the OS is installed on the hard drive.</p>
<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-2-2_changing_monitors">Changing monitors</h2>
<ol>
<li>Shutdown the entire system and disconnect the power.</li>
<li>Unplug the monitor.</li>
<li>Plug in new monitor and reconnect the power to the computer.</li>
<li>Reboot to the LiveCD.  Be sure to press F3 to check your resolution options.</li>
<li>Open the MEPIS X-Windows Assistant.</li>
<li>On the Repair tab:

</ol>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-2-2_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Most of the time your monitor will be picked up automatically by MEPIS Linux, and the right graphic driver will be loaded without problem.  If not, try these steps one at a time:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reboot to your MEPIS LiveCD, being careful to choose resolution carefully by clicking F3 to select the appropriate screen resolution.  If the LiveCD works with your monitor, then follow the steps above to copy your xorg.conf file over to the hard drive.
</li>
<li>Use <a href="index.html#section05-3-4">the MEPIS X Windows Assistant</a> to install the correct graphics driver

<h2 id="s05-2-4_basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Here are the basic steps to take:</p>
<ul><!-- ##########  start  main list  ##########  -->
<li>First, plug in the webcam, and see if it works! Webcams using common drivers will often work just fine.
<br />
 To test whether it is working, try these options: 

<ul> <!-- ##########  start sublist  ##########  -->
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > Internet > Kopete (Instant Messenger)</strong>, then click on the menu bar <strong>Settings > Configure... >Devices</strong>. After a few seconds, you should see the webcam's view.
</li>
<li>Install <strong>Skype</strong>, then click on Options >Video Devices, and click on the Test button.
</li>
<li>Install <strong>cheese</strong>, then click Video and Start recording.
</li>
<li>Install <strong>camstream</strong>, then click File >Open Viewer and select your webcam.
</li>
</ul></li><!-- ########## end sublist  ##########  -->

<li>If one of those procedures does not work--and webcams often only work with certain applications--get the brand and model and USB ID of your webcam by opening a terminal and typing:
<pre>lsusb
</pre>
Output for the webcam will resemble this:
<pre>Bus 001 Device 002: ID <strong>046d:0870</strong> Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Express
</pre>
</li>
<li>Google the device ID (bolded) to find out about its driver and Linux status.
</li>
<li>Check the webcam tables linked below for information and help.
</li>
<li>Search MEPIS community forum, then post your brand, model and device ID number (use <strong>lsusb</strong>) if still having trouble.
</li>
</ul><!-- ########## end  main list  ##########  -->

<p>NOTE: If looking to buy a new webcam, many users report consistent good luck with those supported by <strong>uvcvideo</strong>, and <strong>gspca</strong>, now supplied as kernel modules.</p>

<h1 id="section05-2-5">5.2.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to set up a scanner </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Scanners are supported in Linux by SANE (&ldquo;Scanner Access Now Easy&rdquo;) which is an <em>application programming interface</em>
(API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and still-cameras,
frame-grabbers, etc.).</p>
<br />

<h2>Basic steps</h2>
<p>You can manage your scanner in MEPIS Linux with the KDE frontend Kooka (not installed by default) by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > System > Synaptic Package Manager</strong>.</li> 
<li>Locate and install the <strong>kooka</strong> package (see 7: Software Management)</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > Graphics > Kooka (Scan and OCR Program)</strong></li>
<li>Kooka will check the system for scanners and present you with a list of what it  has found.</li>
<li>For details on how to use Kooka, see the Kooka handbook linked below.</li>
<li>A good alternative for flatbed scanners involves installing <strong>kipi-plugins</strong> from the repos, which will give you a basic scanner under <strong>Start Menu > Graphics > Acquire Images</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-2-5_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your scanner is listed as supported by SANE by following the link below.</li>
<li>Sometimes there is a conflict with another driver that leads to various odd behaviors.  To check:
<ol> <!--sublist -->
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > System > Dolphin as Su (File Manager as su)</strong>, and provide the root password. </li>
<li>Type (or copy and paste) into the address bar:
<pre>
/etc/sane.d/dll.d/libsane-extras
</pre>
</li>

<li>The file will open.  There should be a <strong># </strong> symbol at the beginning of this line to &ldquo;comment out&rdquo; the driver:
<pre>
geniusvp2
</pre>
</li>
<li>If not, put one there, save the file and exit </li>
</ol></li> <!--end sublist -->

<h1  id="section05-2-6">5.2.6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to set up a PDA </h1>
<p>Success with using a PDA on MEPIS Linux depends on the handheld OS and hardware being used.</p>

<h2>Palm devices</h2>
<p>
        PalmOS devices have traditionally worked pretty well with Linux. All interactions depend on pilot-link, an application that is not installed by default with MEPIS Linux. On MEPIS Linux, users have had success using Jpilot to sync data to the desktop, though without integration into KDE applications such as Calendar or Contacts.
      </p>
<h3 id="s05-2-6_prelim">Preliminaries</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your handheld data are backed up before you start.</li>
<li>Make sure all your device entries are correct, including spelling and capitalization</li>
<li>If you are using a Palm device that has been used on another PC, restore the factory defaults (hard reset)</li>
<li>Make sure that the modules you need are loaded: <strong>visor</strong>, <strong>usbserial</strong> and <strong>uhci_hcd</strong> or <strong>ehci_hcd</strong>.  See the Wiki on handling modules, linked below.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s05-2-6_setup">Setup</h3>
<p>The following technique works on MEPIS with many Palm devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using any installation method, install these packages:
<pre>
pilot-link
jpilot
libpisock9
</pre>There is a more recent version of Jpilot available from Debian Testing (Squeeze) that installs without problem on MEPIS Linux
</li>
<li> Connect your Palm handheld to the computer</li>
<li>Open Jpilot (<strong>Start Menu > Office</strong>) and click on File > Preferences > Settings, and select the appropriate Serial Port from the pull-down menu.  When using a cradle On MEPIS, the choice of <strong>usb:</strong> will usually work.
</li>
<li>Press the hotsync button on the Palm device, then click the hotsync icon on the lower left in J-Pilot. It should start syncing.  Sometimes, you may need to wait 5 seconds before pressing the JPilot icon.</li>
<li>Once setup has worked, you can usually perform a hot sync simply by pressing the hot sync button on your handheld or its cradle.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-2-6_other_pdas">Other PDAs</h2>
<p>At the present, synching a PDA that's running Windows Mobile 2003 or 2005 OS is somewhat difficult, as is any RIM Blackberry PDA. However, there are active projects working on this and you can use Bluetooth to move files.  Check the sites linked below for new developments.</p>

<h2 id="s05-2-6_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul><li>Go through the preliminary steps again.  Be sure that the modules are loaded.</li>
<li>Plug your handheld directly into the PC (no hub).</li>
</ul>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.3.1  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section05-3-1">5.3.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;  Network Assistant </h1>
<br />
<i>See <a href="index.html#section05-6-0">Section 5.6</a> for details on networking configuration.</i>
<p>Configure your network access with MEPIS Network Assistant (command line: <strong>mnetwork</strong>), by clicking <strong>Start Menu > Settings > MEPIS Network Assistant</strong>.  The interface has five tabs.  Be sure to click Apply when you make a change on any tab (you will see a warning if you don't).</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-1_general-tab">General tab</h2>
<ul> <!-- start  unordered list-->
<li>Interface status
This panel at the top of the screen displays the active interfaces and indicates their status following an obvious color code.  If you hover your cursor over any interface you will see details on its current state.</li>
<li>Interface Configuration Mode: 
<ul><!--sublist-->
<li>The <u>Automatic</u> mode using NetworkManager is default on MEPIS Linux.  It allows easy connection to access points through any active interface.</li>
<li>The <u>Manual</u> mode may work better, especially when interface problems (e.g., with WPA encryption) show up in automatic mode.  Check that box to activate it and, if necessary, then Apply. If the NetworkManager icon is in the system tray of the Panel at the bottom right of the screen, right-click it to quit so that it does not interfere with the manual mode.</li>
</ul> <!-- end sublist-->
</li>

<li>Driver Preferences:
<ul><!--sublist-->
<li>Select the Broadcom <strong>wl</strong> driver for newer cards with the chipset BCM4310 to 4312, BCM 4322, and BCM4328.  Select the Broadcom <strong>b43</strong> kernel drivers for older chipsets such as BCM4306.
</li>
<li>On the use of Ndiswrapper to allow the use of Windows drivers in Linux, see <a href="index.html#section05-6-0">Section 5.6</a>. 
</li>
<li>The Broadcom drivers may interfere with each other, so you should uncheck the one that you are not using.  Similarly, ndiswrapper should not be used if you are relying on a kernel module, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Check the box for the ipv6 driver (the next-generation Internet Protocol version) if you need it for a particular use.  Since it can slow down connections, it is disabled by default.</li>
</ul> </li><!-- end sublist-->

<li>Configure Domain Name Service Source: allows you to adjust how DNS is set.
</li>
<li>Network Control: permits restarting the network when changes have been made.  In some cases, you may have to reboot for the changes to take effect.</li>
</ul>
<!-- end  unordered list-->

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-3-1_wireless-tab">Wireless tab</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are using wireless for internet access, note which interface (e.g. wlan0) you're using. </li>
<li>Enter the name of your network (SSID), if you know it; you can also try <strong>any</strong> or <strong>default</strong>.  To see what networks are available, click Scan Access Points.  All found will show up in the SSID box along with an indication of their strength, and you can select the one you want.  Rarely you may need to adjust the frequency (channel) in order to avoid conflict with other devices using the 2.4 GHz band. </li>
<li>Select your encryption mode (see WEP and WPA), if any, and enter the key. Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-1_interfaces-tab">Interfaces tab</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the pull-down menu to get to your interface, then click Start at boot. If you don't know which interface name you should use, open a terminal, become root, and type:
<pre>iwconfig</pre>
</li>
<li>Uncheck Start at boot for any other interfaces you will <em>not</em> be using.</li>
<li>Check the Start/Restart on Apply box and then Apply at the bottom to quickly restart the interface.</li>
<li>If you need to, you can configure static IP settings.</li>
<li>Click Apply then OK. You may have to reboot for the changes to take effect, though usually that is not necessary.  On the LiveCD, go back instead to the <strong>General</strong> 
tab and click Stop Network, then Re/Start Network.
</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />


<h2>Troubleshooting tab</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware</strong>  Clicking on Scan hardware will return a detailed description of your network cards and chipsets.  Be sure to report this information when seeking help.</li>

<li><strong>Associated drivers</strong>

<ul>
<li><u>Linux drivers</u>.  Any drivers associated with your wireless hardware will be listed here.</li>
<li><u>Windows drivers</u>.  This panel allows you to see associated Windows drivers for use with Ndiswrapper, as well as to add or remove a driver, or even to blacklist Ndiswrapper if it is interfering with a Linux driver you want to use.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />


<h2>Diagnosis tab</h2>
<p>This tab provides easy access to network diagnostic problems using well-established tools.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ping</strong> is used to send small data packets to another network host as a basic test for connectivity. It will test your connection to any IP address or hostname you give it; try something like <strong>www.yahoo.com</strong> to see how it works.  Ten packets is often enough, but you can select any number by using the arrows.  Consult the MEPIS Wiki link in the <a href="#s05-3_links"> Links and Guides</a> section on how to read and use the output. </li>

<li><strong>Traceroute</strong> shows you the route over the network between two systems, listing all the intermediate routers a connection must pass through ("hops") to get to its destination. It can help you determine why your connections to a given server might be poor, and can often help you figure out where exactly the problem is. Try something like <strong>www.yahoo.com</strong> to see how it works.  Ten hops is often enough, but you can select any number by using the arrows.  Consult the MEPIS Wiki in the <a href="#s05-3_links"> Links and Guides</a> section on how to read and use the output.</li> 
</ul>




<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<p>This utility allows you to make various adjustments to your system, running as root. You can start the utility from <strong>Start Menu > Settings > MEPIS System Assistant</strong> (command line: <strong>msystem</strong>).  The interface has four tabs:</p>

<ul>
<li id="s05-3-2_options"><u>Options</u>: Here you can configure computer identity (name, domain, workgroup), system locale, keyboard layout 
(use KDE System Settings to enable keyboard layouts if different from system) and space recovery.
</li>

<li id="s05-3-2_usbkey"><u>MEPIS USB key</u>: This tab is for setting up a bootable Live USB key for netbooks or OnTheGo (see link below).
</li>

<li id="s05-3-2_repair-sysboot"><u>Repair System Boot</u>: This tab is used for repairing the MBR (Master Boot Record).  It is normally
used when running from the LiveCD.
</li>

<li id="s05-3-2_repair-partition"><u>Repair Partition</u>:
This tab allows a partition to be tested for errors and bad blocks.  It may not be run from within the partition that needs to be
checked, and for that reason is usually run from the LiveCD.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.3.3  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section05-3-3">5.3.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;  User Assistant </h1>
<p>This utility aids in adding, editing, removing users to your system.  You can start the utility from <strong>Start Menu > Settings > MEPIS User Assistant</strong>.  It has four tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li id="s05-3-3_repair-user"><u>Repair</u>: by checking the appropriate box, you can restore the defaults for any user's group memberships,
KDE application configurations, and Firefox configurations.</li>

</ul>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.3.4  ########################### -->


<h1 id="section05-3-4">5.3.4:&nbsp;&nbsp; X-Windows Assistant </h1>
<p>This utility brings together a number of configuration steps for <strong>&ldquo;X&rdquo;</strong>, the window system used by MEPIS Linux.
You can start it from <strong>Start Menu > Settings > MEPIS X-Windows Assistant</strong> (command line: <strong>mxconfig</strong>). 
It has six
tabs.</p>

<h2 id="s05-3-4_repair-x">Repair </h2>

<p>This tab is intended to be used from the LiveCD. It allows you to copy the automatically-generated X configuration from the LiveCD
onto a hard drive installation of MEPIS Linux. This is useful if you've made a configuration error and the X graphical interface will no longer
start (all you get is a command-line log-in prompt)</p>

<ul>
<li>In the first line, specify the destination disk from the pull-down menu.</li>
<li>In the second, select the partition where &ldquo;/&rdquo; is mounted. </li>
<li>When you click OK or Apply, X-Windows Assistant will copy the X configuration file
<strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong> from the LiveCD to the folder on the partition you have specified.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This utility is only useful from a hard drive install when you have MEPIS Linux or a similar Debian-based Linux distribution on another
partition, and you'd like to copy the <strong>xorg.conf</strong> file from that one to another.</p>
<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_general-x">General </h2>
<p>This tab allows you to change the dpi (dots-per-inch) setting of on-screen text. Change this if your monitor's size or resolution causes text to be too large or too small and you want to uniformly increase or decrease the size of all text rendered in X windows.</p> 
<p>NOTE: The font sizes of KDE applications can be adjusted under <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings</strong>, click Appearance then Fonts. </p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_mouse-x">Mouse </h2>
<p>This tab simply allows you to activate or deactivate different mouse types on your system. Most users shouldn't have a reason to deactivate any of these devices; MEPIS Linux will work fine even if nonexistent mouse devices are enabled.</p>
<p>NOTE: More fine-tuned control of the mouse's behavior is available under <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings</strong>, click Keyboard and then Mouse.</p>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_monitor-x">Monitor </h2>
<p>This tool allows you to specify the brand and model of your Monitor, and if necessary, alter its frequencies. Changing the frequencies
may be necessary if you are having trouble getting the full range of available video resolutions from your monitor.</p>

<p>If you don't find your monitor listed in the brand/model menus, you can type in the monitor's vertical and horizontal frequency ranges
manually. Make sure you consult your monitor's documentation! </p>
<p>NOTES: 1) Be very careful with this tool! Setting your monitor to the wrong model or setting the wrong frequency ranges can cause you
to lose video, or even potentially damage your monitor. If you are happy with the resolution you are getting, it's best to leave this tool
alone.  2) See <a href="index.html#section05-5">Section 5.5</a> for detailed display configuration and troubleshooting.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_nvidia">NVIDIA </h2>
<p>If you have an Nvidia graphics card, this tool assists you in installing the drivers. You have a choice of four drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>The latest Nvidia driver</u>: This is a proprietary driver that works with newer Nvidia cards - see the Nvidia Unix Portal page linked below for supported products list. </li>
<li><u>The legacy Nvidia driver</u>: This is also a proprietary driver, but it works with older Nvidia cards (for Riva/TNT/GeForce 2 - use the 7xxx from the Nvidia website linked below. </li>
<li><u>The NV driver</u>: This is an open-source driver from Xorg, but it lacks 3D support.</li> 
<li><u>VESA</u>: This is a generic driver that provides basic functionality (2D, 1024x768 resolution) to most video cards. Use it for troubleshooting, or as a temporary driver before you use the script <strong>sgfxi</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using the proprietary drivers, you can set other options here such as dual monitor settings or shadow curser mode.</p> 
<p>NOTE: If you are uncertain of which driver to use, consult the list of NVIDIA supported cards linked below.</p>

<br /><br />

</ul>

<br /><br />
<h1 id="section05-3-5">5.3.4:&nbsp;&nbsp; NDisWrapper Assistant </h1>
<p>This new utility allows you to view, install and remove Windows drivers, as well as to blacklist the kernel module ndiswrapper itself using self-explanatory buttons.  You can start it from <strong>Start Menu > System > MEPIS NDisWrapper Manager</strong> (command line: <strong>mndiswrapper</strong>).  For details, see Section 5.6.1.2 on NDisWrapper.</p>
<br /><br />

<h1 id="section05-3-6">5.3.4:&nbsp;&nbsp; MEPIS Welcome Center</h1>
<p>This is another new utility that aims to make the user's first encoutner with MEPIS Linux as friendly as possible. You can start it from <strong>Start Menu > System > MEPIS Welcome Center</strong> (command line: <strong>mwelcome</strong>).  From this Center you can research a topic using MEPIS documentation, join the Community forum, contribute to MEPIS development, install a language pack, activate the Community repos, or add popular applications with a single click.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.4  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section05-4">5.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GRUB bootloader</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GRUB is the default boot loader used by MEPIS Linux.  A boot loader is software that tells your computer where to find operating
systems to boot. When you start your computer, GRUB will provide you with a menu of choices. It is a very powerful boot loader that can load a wide variety of free operating systems, as well as proprietary operating systems with an indirect boot technique known as <a
href="index.html#s12-1_chainloading"  class="spterm" title="A method of loading other operating systems."> chainloading.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-4_overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The typical default GRUB screen in MEPIS Linux  shows 3 kernel entries for MEPIS, any other detected OS, and a MEMTEST entry.  It looks something like this (here for a dual_boot with Windows XP on a system with a single hard drive): </p>
<pre>
timeout 10
color cyan/blue white/blue
foreground ffffff
background 0639a1

gfxmenu /boot/grub/message

title MEPIS at sda2, newest kernel
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 nomce quiet splash vga=791 
boot

title MEPIS at sda2, previous kernel (if any)
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz.old root=/dev/sda2 nomce quiet splash vga=791 
boot

title MEPIS at sda2, kernel 2.6.32-1-mepis-smp
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-1-mepis-smp root=/dev/sda2
boot

title Microsoft Windows XP Professional at sda1
rootnoverify (hd0,0)
chainloader +1

title MEMTEST
kernel /boot/memtest86+.bin
</pre>

<p>Three kernel entries are listed for technical reasons: details in the Wiki discussion of GRUB under <em> Links and Guides</em> below.
</p>
<p>The final entry, Memtest is a thorough, stand-alone memory test for all Intel or AMD-based systems. It writes a series of test patterns
to every memory address, then reads back the data written and compares it for errors.  See <a href="index.html#section08-07">Section 8.7</a>.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-4_grub">Configuring GRUB</h2>
<p>After successfully installing a dual-boot system, many people want to adapt it to their environment.  Warning: making mistakes in editing GRUB configuration may render your system unbootable. To recover from this situation see Section 5.3.2 for 'Repair System Boot'.</p>
<h3>Configuring the boot menu timeout</h3>
<p>It is possible to change the length of time for which the boot menu is shown. This is useful if you would like the computer to start up
faster (without the delay of showing the menu) or would like more time to choose which operating system to start.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Click Start Menu > System > Dolphin as su</strong>, and supply the root password.</li>
<li>Click Ctrl-L to open the navigation bar, and type <strong>/boot/grub/menu.lst</strong> and hit return.  This will open the configuration file for GRUB
(menu.lst) that you can now edit in KWrite, the default text editor.</li>
<li>The first line contains text similar to the following:
<pre>
timeout 10
</pre>
This line determines the time, in seconds, during which the boot menu will be shown. Change the number on this line to the number of seconds you would like. Use <strong>0</strong> if you would not like the menu to be shown at all so that the default entry will be booted automatically.</li>
<li>Click <strong>File > Save</strong> to save your changes and then <strong>Exit</strong>. Your changes should take effect the next
time you restart your computer.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<h3 id="s05-4_change-default">Changing the default operating system to boot</h3>
<p>You can decide which operating system will be started automatically if you have not chosen one from the boot menu within a certain time.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>boot/grub/menu.lst</strong> file as root using the method indicated above, and add the following option just above the first
&ldquo;title&rdquo; entry:</p>

<pre>
default <em>n</em>
</pre>

<p>Change the variable <em>n</em> to &ldquo;0&rdquo; to boot from the first entry in the menu, &ldquo;1&rdquo; for the second, and so forth.
Save the file and exit. The changes will take effect the next time the computer boots.
</p>
<p>An alternative method is to cut the whole entry for the OS you want to boot by default and paste it in the first title position.</p>

<br />

<h1  id="section05-6-0">5.6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Network </h1>
<h2>  Introduction</h2>

<p>A computer network is simply defined as “A connection of two or more computers so that they can share resources.” Resources are in the form of hardware (i.e., printers), software, data, Internet connection, etc. Setting up a home network is a fairly straightforward task. But it is a good idea to arm yourself with a little knowledge to make things easier, as well as safer (from a security point of view). See Links and Guides below for background information. </p>
<p>We will be dealing with the various methods of internet access separately in subsequent sections, but all of them can be managed in MEPIS in one convenient location by clicking <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings > Network Settings</strong>.</p>

<h2> Overview</h2>

<p>The discussion of networking breaks up into five areas:</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.6.1.1  ########################### -->


<h1  id="section05-6-1-1">5.6.1.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wired Internet Access </h1>

<p>MEPIS Linux typically picks up wired internet access upon boot without much problem.</p>

<h3>Ethernet and cable</h3>

<p>MEPIS Linux comes preconfigured for a standard LAN (Local Area Network) that uses DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to assign IP addresses and DNS (Domain Name System) resolution. This will work in most cases as-is. You can change the configuration with the MEPIS Network Assistant (see <a href="index.html#section05-3">Section 5.3</a>).

When you boot MEPIS Linux, your network adapters are assigned a short interface name by udev, the kernel's device manager. For normal wired adapters this is usually eth0 (with subsequent adapters eth1, eth2, eth3, etc). Wireless adapters often come up on the eth0 interface in MEPIS Linux, but the interface name depends on the adapter's chipset. For instance, atheros cards often show up as ath0, while ralink usb adapters will be rausb0. To find out what interfaces have been detected and named in your system, click Start Menu > System > KInfoCenter (Info Center) > Network Interfaces. For more details, open a terminal, become root, and enter: </p>
<pre>ifconfig -a</pre>

<p>It is highly recommended that you have a firewall (see <a href="index.html#section05-6-2">Section 5.6.2</a>) running if you are connecting directly to the Internet with your PC!  If you are running a stand-alone/external firewall, most of which will run DHCP by default, simply connect to the
router/hub/switch and your machine should autoconfigure via DHCP. </p>

<h3>ADSL or PPPoE</h3>

<p>If you use ADSL or PPPoE, connecting to the internet is easy in MEPIS Linux.  Click <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings > Network Settings</strong>, then the DSL tab.  Click the Add... button and fill in the required information, checking to connect automatically if you want.</p>
<p>NOTE: you may encounter problems when using a USB device to connect instead of going through a router.  If that happens, plug the unit into the computer, open Konsole, and type:</p>
<pre>dmesg | tail</pre>
<p>Post a message on MEPIS community with the output to get some help on finding the driver you need.</p>
<h3>Dial-Up</h3>

<p>If you use a dialup connection with your computer, you will use KPPP. Click <strong>Start Menu > Internet > KPPP (Internet Dial-Up Tool)</strong> to define an account, test that the modem is working, and dial your ISP.  A wizard makes the process painless, but for configuration details you can consult the KPPP Handbook in Links and Guides.</p>

<p>On the Device tab you will need to set up the serial information.  Accepting the default  <strong>/dev/modem</strong> may work, but you might need to try another interface. These are the Linux equivalents of the COM ports under MS-DOS and MS-Windows&#174;:</p>

<ul>
 <li>COM 1 - /dev/ttyS0</li>
 <li>COM 2 - /dev/ttyS1</li>
 <li>COM 3 - /dev/ttyS2</li>
 <li>COM 4 - /dev/ttyS3</li>
</ul>
 
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: For some users, KPPP does not work correctly in MEPIS Linux.  Consult the KPPP section of the MEPIS Wiki linked below for solutions that users have found.  If you continue to have difficulties, you should install <strong>gnome-ppp</strong> and try connecting with that application instead.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-6-1-1_clu">Command line utilities</h2>
<p>Command line utilities are useful for seeing detailed information, and are also commonly used in troubleshooting.  Most must be run <u>as root</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
ifconfig - main configuration utility for network interfaces. Full documentation can be found by typing <strong>man:ifconfig</strong> into
the Dolphin address bar.
</li>
<li>ifup interface - bring up the specified interface. For example: 
<pre>ifup eth0 - command that brings up the ethernet port eth0
ifup wlan0 - command that brings up the wireless port wlan0
</pre>
</li>
<li>ifdown interface - the opposite of <strong>ifup</strong>. 
</li>
<li>iwconfig - wireless network connection utility. Full documentation can be found by typing <strong>man:iwconfig</strong> into the Dolphin Location bar . For example: 
<pre>
iwconfig - by itself, iwconfig will display your wireless status
iwconfig eth0 essid any - this command connects eth0 
                          to any AP in range
iwconfig wlan0 essid foo - connects wlan0 to AP with essid "foo"
iwconfig eth0 key off - clears out the WEP key
iwconfig ath0 key 12345678901 - sets ath0's WEP key 
                                to 12345678901
</pre>
</li>
<li>
iwlist - another wireless ethernet utility. In Dolphin, type the URL: <strong>man:iwlist</strong> for the Iwlist man page. Example of use: 
<pre>
iwlist wlan0 scanning - shows properties of wireless networks 
                        within range of wlan0.
iwlist ath0 bitrate   - shows the current speed of 
                        communications on ath0.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-6-1-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Ethernet cards in MEPIS Linux are configured in the file <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong>. The file is actually very simple in format and syntax, and not hard to edit in the event that other tools fail. See documentation by typing "man:interfaces" into the address bar of Dolphin.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.6.1.2  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section05-6-1-2">5.6.1.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wireless Internet Access </h1>

<p>MEPIS Linux comes preconfigured to autodetect a WiFi card, and in many cases your card will be found and set up.  If not, see below for the basic steps for enabling wireless.</p>

<p>There are three ways wireless can be supported in MEPIS:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a native driver that comes as part of the Linux kernel (example: <strong>ipw3945</strong> for Intel).</li>

<li>With a Windows driver using the application Ndiswrapper (supplied by default), which "wraps" your Windows driver so that it can be used in a Linux system (example: <strong>bcmwl5</strong> for Broadcom). </li>
<li>With a Windows driver using the commercial product Linuxant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there is both a native Linux driver and a Windows driver available.  You may want to compare them for speed and connectivity, and you may have to remove the one you are not using to prevent a conflict.  For more information, see Links and Guides below.</p>

<p>Wireless cards can be either internal or external.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some computers contain inexpensive internal modems that are designed only for use with MS-Windows.  These are called variously
winmodems, linmodems or  softmodems. MEPIS Linux includes drivers for many common winmodems, but others may prove more difficult to
configure.</li>
<li>External serial wireless modems generally tend to work without problem. </li> 

<li>USB modems (wireless dongles) usually show up on the rausb0 interface.</li>
</ul>


<p>NOTE: The successful method varies for users because of the complicated interactions among the Linux kernel, wireless tools, and the local wireless card chipset and router.</p>

<br />

<h3 id="s05-6-1-2_3gmodems">3G modems</h3>
<p>For wireless internet access using a 3G modem, please refer to the Debian Wiki's 3G pages linked at the bottom of the page.</p>

<br /><br />


<!--This is modified from separate "wireless" page in M7-->
<h2 id="s05-6-1-2_basic">Basic Wireless Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Click on the Network Manager icon in the system tray on the right side of the panel, and follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Click on the line that gives the name of an interface (e.g., wlan0) and says "Create network connection"</li>

<li>A list with found network names (ESSIDs) pops up. Choose your network name and click Connect.</li> 

<li>A config window opens up.  Fill in the security details in the new window. Pay attention: the system will try to detect the correct encryption type (e.g. WEP or WPA), but you may need to verify if it is set correctly.</li>

<li>Make sure to check 'Automatically connect' in this same window if you want your machine to connect without user intervention the next time you are within reach of this network.  After filling out the required details, hit OK.</li>

<li>The KWallet system wizard opens up.  Click Next</li>

<li>If you want to use the KDE wallet to store personal information, check the box.  For now, it is easier if you leave it unchecked and click Finish. The connection will be made.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Examples of wireless interfaces include:

<ul>
<li><strong>eth1</strong>, when a kernel module is being used and a wired interface exists</li>

<li><strong>wlan0</strong>, when ndiswrapper is operating</li>

<li><strong>ra0</strong> for cards with Ralink 2500 chipsets using the native driver.  If an external device such as a dongle is being used, this will show up as <strong>rausb0</strong></li>

</ul>
For a full list, consult the Debian Wiki on Wifi linked below.</li>

<li>If Network Manager does not see a network, open the MEPIS Network Assistant (see Section 5.3).  On the General tab, click on the radio button for Manual (mnetwork) to deactivate Network Manager.  Then click on the Troubleshooting tab. In the top panel, Hardware, click the Scan Hardware button to find the information about your chipset that you need to get help. The output will show all recognized interfaces.</li>

<li>If an <u>interface is found</u>:

<ul>

<li>Search out any conflicts between drivers: 1) if you have a Broadcom chipset, use MEPIS Network Assistant to turn off all drivers except the one you want to use; 2) Atheros-based chipsets can cause more than one module to be loaded, preventing a proper connection.</li>

<li>Try another connection manager such as Wicd or Ceni.  Wicd is a popular choice for many Linux distributions, and can be gotten from the MEPIS repositories.  Ceni must be downloaded from the link below and installed; it is particularly useful for hidden access points and other difficult situations.  Please note that MEPIS can not guarantee the performance of these applications.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>If <u>no interface is found</u>:

<ul>
<li>Open a terminal and type:<pre>lspci</pre> or <pre>lsusb</pre></li>

<li>Note the detailed information on your specific hardware, and look for more information about that from the Debian Wiki on Wifi, from the LinuxWireless site listed below, or on MEPIS community forum.</li>

<li>Although we would like to use native drivers, in some cases you will want or need to use ndiswrapper and a Windows driver.  This may be because you can't otherwise connect, or because the connection is better.  See below for details.</li>

<li>For some cards it is necessary to install firmware, the small programs and data structures that internally control the electronic components.  MEPIS comes with quite a bit of firmware already available, but you may have to track down your particular need (for Intel-based chipsets, for example).  Use the LinuxWireless website linked below.</li>

<li>Open a terminal and type <pre>dmesg | grep net</pre> and look for any error message.</li>

<li>Report all relevant information in a post on MEPIS community forum, and ask for help</li>

</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Native drivers</h2>
<p>MEPIS Linux includes a large number of native wireless drivers among its kernel modules.  The directions vary somewhat for each, and in some cases you will need to also obtain the firmware (small programs that internally control various electronic devices).  Pease consult the MEPIS Wiki on native drivers, linked below.</p>


<h2>Ndiswrapper</h2>
<p>Ndiswrapper is an open source software driver "wrapper" that enables the use of Microsoft Windows drivers for wireless network devices in Linux.  It comes pre-installed in MEPIS Linux, along with a number of the most common Windows drivers.  Note that you MUST use a Windows 32-bit driver if you have MEPIS 32-bit edition and you MUST use a Windows 64-bit driver if you have MEPIS 64-bit edition. In general, Windows-XP drivers work much better than Vista drivers, so try the Windows-XP driver first. </p>

<p>Here are the steps you should take to get wireless working with Ndiswrapper:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open up MEPIS NDisWrapper Manager (<strong>Start Menu > System</strong>).</li>

<li>Look in the main window for one of the drivers there that is associated with your hardware. </li>

<li>If no driver is already associated, obtain the XP drivers for your card either from your legacy installation or from other sources (check the Wiki).</li>

<li>Once you have placed the driver files (especially the *.inf and *.sys files) into a location on your computer, return to the MEPIS NDisWrapper Manager.</li>

<li>Using the Remove Driver button, highlight and remove the existing drivers one at a time until none are left.</li>

<li>Click on the Install driver button, navigate to the location where you placed the XP driver files, highlight the file and click OK</li>

<li>Click OK to close, and reboot your computer.</li>

<li>If you are not connected when you reboot, go back to the MEPIS Network Assistant and make sure your network ESSID is entered on the Wireless tab.  If not, enter it, click Apply, and restart the interface on the Interfaces tab.</li>

<li>If you still have trouble, consult the Wiki or post the information described above in the last of the Basic Steps on MEPIS community forum.
</li>

</ul>

<h1 id="section05-6-2">5.6.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Firewalls </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A firewall is a device or application used to filter data packets from incoming or outgoing network traffic, usually based upon the IP address or type of service (literally, the port number). Firewall configurations sometimes need to be adjusted if you add a new network service or change the port of an existing network service on your computer.</p>
<p> Although MEPIS Linux does not come with a software firewall preinstalled and configured, it is recommended you use one as a safety precaution.  Firewalls are aimed at two groups of users: novice to intermediate users who are not experts in networking and security, and users who don't want the hassle of dealing with using scripts and parameters. See Links and Guides for more details. </p>
<br />

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Most firewall programs available for MEPIS Linux are merely frontends for Netfilter/iptables, the network filtering module in newer Linux kernels. So, the real differences among different firewalls are the way the interface works and what options are available. Here are several alternatives: (See Links and Guides for more details)</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.6.3  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section05-6-3">5.6.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  File sharing </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>MEPIS Linux can handle a large variety of networking protocols to make files and directories available to other computers on your network. Many people accustomed to Windows may be confused by the variety of file sharing protocols and not understand why there are so many when Windows simply allows you to "share" files without much rigamarole. Being open, though, Linux allows you to choose the protocol that best suits your needs.</p>

<br />
<h2 id="s05-6-3_samba">Samba</h2>
<p>This is the protocol used by Windows machines (which they call SMB: &ldquo;Server Message Block&rdquo;). Samba is the most complete solution to share files with Windows machines on your network without making changes to the Windows machines. Samba sets up network "shares" (directories available for other users) for chosen Linux directories and all contained subdirectories. These appear to Microsoft Windows users as normal Windows folders accessible via the network.</p>
<p>It also offers some other services for interfacing with Windows networks, such as domain authentication, messaging services, and netbios name resolution.  Finally, it provides an easy method of connecting Linux machines to each other and even to Mac machines.</p>
<p>Password protection is enabled by clicking <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings > Sharing</strong>, and entering a default user name and password.  To configure shares for Windows, right-click the desktop >Run Command, and enter:</p>
 <pre>kdesu systemsettings</pre>
<p>Enter root's password, then click on the Advanced tab > Samba.</p>
<p>Setup in MEPIS Linux is very easy.  Use Dolphin to navigate to the folder/directory you want to share.  Right-click and select Properties.  Click on the Share tab, then on the button Configure File Sharing.  Provide root's password, and then define the users and folders available to Samba.</p>

<ul> <!--list 1 -->
<li>Pros:
  
<ul> <!--sublist 1a -->
<li>Looks and acts just like a Windows file share to clients.</li>

<li>Has lots of Windows networking features beyond file sharing (Domain authentication, Windows messaging service, netbios names, print sharing, etc). </li>

<li>Very flexible and configurable.</li>

</ul> </li> <!--end sublist 1a -->

<li>Cons:
<ul><!-- sublist 1b -->
<li>Not the most stable option</li>
<li>Can be confusing to set up on the server side, because some of the terminology is different.</li>
<li>Security can be weird, since Windows clients are not all consistent in how they deal with security.</li>
<li>Not the best choice if you have relatively few (or no) Windows computers involved.</li>
</ul></li><!--end sublist 1b -->
</ul> <!-- end list 1 -->

 



<br /><br />


<h2 id="s05-6-3_other">Other methods</h2>

<ul><!-- top level list -->
<!--  *************************** NFS  ***************************  -->
<li>NFS:<br />
This is the standard Unix protocol for sharing files. Many feel it is better  than Samba for sharing files, and it can be used with Windows (2000 &amp; XP) machines if you install <em>Services for Unix</em> or a third-party NFS client on them. For more information, see Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.
<ul>  <!-- sublist 1 -->

<li>Pros:
<ul><!--sublist 1a -->
<li>More mature and stable than Samba for Linux / Unix servers.</li>
<li>Simpler and less cumbersome than Samba.</li>
</ul></li><!--end sublist 1a -->

<li>Cons:
<ul><!--sublist 1b -->
<li>Windows clients require extra configuration.</li>
<li>Terminology somewhat different from what Windows users are used to using.</li>
</ul></li><!--end sublist 1b -->

</ul></li><!-- end sublist 1 -->


<!--  *************************** SSHFS  ***************************  -->
<li>SSHFS:<br />
This is a pretty new protocol that requires some additional installation on Mepis (at least for the client).  It is a mountable filesystem protocol implemented using SSH, so it is encrypted and only requires that the server be running SSH. For more information, see Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.

<ul> <!-- sublist 2 -->
<li>Pros:
<ul>  <!-- sublist 2a -->
<li>Server only needs to be running SSHD: nothing else to set up.</li>
<li>All transmissions encrypted for security.</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist 2a -->

<li>Cons:
<ul>  <!-- sublist 2b -->
<li>Requires extra setup on the client -- modules need to be compiled, permissions set up, folders mounted, etc.</li>
<li>Hard to control what user has access to; anything they can access locally is available over the network.</li>
<li>Cannot setup "anonymous" shares. (?) (At least not without a major security compromise).</li>
<li>Forget about using this with Windows clients.</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 2b -->
</ul></li><!-- end sublist 2 -->

<!--  *************************** FTP  ***************************  -->
<li>FTP<br />
This is a very old protocol that still enjoys common use and support.  It does not have all the features of other protocols and is somewhat insecure, but is a good choice if you are going to share files out to the internet and you have a wide variety of client OS's. For more information,  see Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.

<ul>  <!-- sublist 3 -->
<li>Pros:
<ul>  <!-- sublist 3a -->
<li>Mature protocol, widely recognized.</li>
<li>Most OS's (including Windows) come with ftp clients built in. (On windows, IE is a passable ftp client).</li>
<li>Can be set up for anonymous sharing or secured sharing.</li>
</ul></li>  <!-- end sublist 3a -->

<li>Cons:
<ul>  <!-- sublist 3b -->

<li>Not very secure for use on the internet (passwords sent in plain text).</li>
<li>Not very flexible for sharing out multiple unrelated folders.</li>
<li>Setup can be a bit of a challenge for newbies.</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 3b -->
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 3 -->

<!--  *************************** BIT-TORRENT  ***************************  -->
<li>BitTorrent<br />
BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) communications protocol for distributing large amounts of data widely without the original distributor incurring the entire costs of hardware, hosting and bandwidth resources.  See <a href="index.html#s08-01_bittorrent">Section 8.1: Bit-Torrent</a>.

<h1 id="section05-7">5.7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound Configuration</h1>
<p><em>See also </em><a href="index.html#section08-02">Section 8.2: Multimedia</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Linux has many different ways of interacting with audio hardware. The main two are the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) and the Open Sound System (OSS). KDE builds on these low-level systems with its own Phonon API which all KDE multimedia programs use for playing sound.  Fortunately, MEPIS chooses the most appropriate audio settings automatically and you do not need to worry about the details.</p>

<h2  id="s05-7_restricted">Restricted formats</h2>
<p>People wishing to play back video and audio files in proprietary formats will need to install this packages:</p>

<pre>
libdvdcss2
</pre>

<p>This is available through Synaptic after checking the box next to this repository (see <a href="index.html#section07-2">Section 7.2</a>):</p>
<pre>
deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org lenny main
</pre>

<p>NOTE: The use of this package is of questionable legality in some countries, so please check your local restrictions before installing it.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-7_basic">Basic configuration</h2>
<p>KMix is the recommended way to adjust the details of your sound.</p>
 
<ol>
<li>Open KMix by clicking <strong>Start Menu > Multimedia > KMix</strong>, or by clicking the speaker icon in the system tray (right side of the panel) and clicking on <strong>Mixer</strong>.</li> 
<li>On the Output tab that may carry the name of your soundcard, make sure the Master volume (on the far left) is turned up.</li> 
<li>Also, make sure PCM is turned up (the control with the blue squiggly line above it).  You can hover your cursor over the icons to find out what they mean.</li> 
<li>Make sure that the Mute checkbox next to the slider controls is not ticked.</li>
<li>On the menu bar click <strong>Settings >Configure Kmix</strong> and make certain that <strong>Restore volumes on login</strong> is
checked.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also check that your audio hardware is working correctly in <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings > Multimedia</strong>. Click on the "Music" category in the left-hand panel and select a device in the right-hand panel (there may be more than one). Click "Test" to verify that each device is working correctly. You can determine the primary soundcard by adjusting its priority with the "Defer" button.</p>

<p>NOTE: you cannot play an audio CD by clicking on the CD-ROM icon on the desktop.  You must use an installed player (see <a href="index.html#section08-02">Section 8.2: Multimedia</a>).</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-7_system">System sounds</h2>
<p>You can control KDE system-wide sound settings by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings > Notifications</strong></li>
<li>Click on any event in System Notifications section to make any changes.</li>
</ol>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-7_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>You can set up your sound driver by installing the package <strong>alsaconf</strong> from the Community repos.  Then open a terminal, become root, and type:</p>
<pre>alsaconf</pre>
<p>This will start an automatic process to discover your sound card and install the correct driver.</p>

<p>In order to troubleshoot any problems you will need to know what sound card you have. Open a terminal by clicking <strong>Start Menu > System > Konsole (Terminal)</strong>, and enter this line:</p>
<pre>
lspci | grep -i audio
</pre>

<p>This command asks that all devices be listed that contain the word &ldquo;audio&rdquo; in their description, and the output will tell
you your card manufacturer and model. Here is an example of output:</p>
<pre>
0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp 82801EB/ER (ICH5)
</pre>

<p>With this information, you can use the MEPIS Wiki sound driver
database listed below to track down more information and help, or turn to other resources linked below.  In rare cases, you may have to load a module for your card following the directions linked below.</p>

<p>NOTE: Many of the drivers do not include the <strong>snd-</strong> prefix; you will need to add that to get the actual module name.</p>

<p>Bluetooth is enabled in MEPIS Linux by default through the kernel, but no desktop tools are included for the user.  Bluetooth tools are easily available through Synaptic (see <a href="index.html#section07-2">7.2:&nbsp; Synaptic Software Package Manager</a>) by installing the package:</p>
<pre>kdebluetooth</pre>
<p>(<strong>NOTE</strong>: Kdebluetooth file transfer is broken in MEPIS Linux.  If this is important to you, consider installing the package from Debian Testing (Squeeze), which will provide some functionality.)</p>
<p>Once this package is installed, you will find a whole host of tools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>kbluetooth &mdash; a tray applet to handle incoming inquiries</li>
<li>kbtobexclient &mdash; to send files via bluetooth</li>
<li>kbluemon &mdash; a bluetooth monitor</li>
<li>kinputwizard &mdash; a wizard to configure Input Devices</li>
<li>kbluelock &mdash; a bluetooth screen locker</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools can be found most easily by right-clicking the Bluetooth icon on the right side of the panel, though you can also hunt around Start Menu for them.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 06  ########################### -->



<h1 id="section06-1">6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Command Line </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Although MEPIS Linux offers a complete set of graphical tools for installing, configuring, and using your system, the command line (also called the console, terminal, BASH, or shell) is still a useful and at times indispensible tool.  Here are some common uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a GUI application to see its error output.</li>
<li>Speed up system administration tasks.</li>
<li>Configure or install advanced software applications.</li>
<li>Execute multiple tasks quickly and easily.</li>
<li>Troubleshoot hardware devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default program to run a terminal in a  MEPIS Linux KDE desktop window is <strong>Konsole</strong>, which can be found at <strong>Start Menu > System > Konsole (Terminal)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s06-1_first">First steps</h2>
<p>Though console commands can be fairly complex, understanding the command line is just a matter of putting together simple things.  To see
how easy it can be, open Konsole and try a few basic commands. This will all make more sense if you do it as a tutorial exercise rather
 than just reading it.  Let's start with a simple command: <strong>ls</strong>, which lists the contents of a directory. The basic command
lists the contents of whatever directory you are currently in:</p>
<pre>
ls
</pre>

<p>That's a useful command, but it's just a few short columns of names printed across the screen. Suppose we want more information on the files in this directory. We can add a <strong>switch</strong> to the command to make it print out more information.  A <strong>switch</strong> is a modifier we append to a command to change its behavior.  In this case, the switch we want is:</p>

<pre>
ls -l
</pre>

<p>As you can see on your own screen if you are following along, this switch provides more detailed information on the files in any
directory.  Of course, we might want to see the contents of another directory (without going there first).  To do this, we add an
<strong>argument</strong> to the command, specifying which file we want to look at.  An <strong>argument</strong> is a value or reference we add
to a command to target its operation.  In this case:</p>

<pre>
ls -l /usr/bin/
</pre>

<p>By giving an argument of <strong>/usr/bin</strong>, we can list the contents of that directory, rather than the one where we currently
are.</p>

<p>There are a lot of files in <strong>/usr/bin</strong>!  It would be nice if we could filter this output so that only entries that
contained, say, the word "fire" would be listed.  We can do this by <strong>piping</strong> the output of the <em>ls</em> command into another
command, <strong>grep</strong>.  The <strong>pipe</strong>, or &ldquo;|&rdquo; character, is used to send the output of one command to the input of
another.</p>
<p>The command <strong>grep</strong> searches for the pattern you give it and returns all matches, so piping the output of the previous
command to it filters the output.</p>

<pre>
ls -l /usr/bin/ &#124; grep fire
</pre>
<p>Thanks to <em>grep</em>, we only see the lines of the output that contain the word "fire".  Finally, suppose we want these results saved
in a text file for use at a later time?</p>

<p>When we issue commands, the output is usually directed to the console display; but we can
<em>redirect</em> this output somewhere else, such as to a file, using the <strong>&gt;</strong> (redirect) symbol:</p>
<pre>
ls -l /usr/bin/ &#124; grep fire > FilesOfFire.txt
</pre>
<p>This command now instructs your computer to make a detailed list of all the files that contain the word "fire" and to create a text file containing that list.  As you can see, the console can be used to perform complex tasks very easily by joining simple commands together in different ways.</p>


<br /><br />


<h2 id="s06-1_common">Common commands</h2>
<p>Here is a list of rudimentary terminal commands.  For a complete reference, see the Links and Guides section. </p>
<table>
<tr><th colspan = "2">Filesystem navigation</th></tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>cd /usr/share</strong></td>
<td>Changes current directory to the given path: &ldquo;/usr/share&rdquo;.  With no argument, <strong>cd</strong> takes you to your home
directory. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>pwd</strong> </td>
<td>Prints the current working directory path</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>ls</strong></td><td>Lists the contents of the current directory.  Use the <strong>-a</strong> switch to show hidden files as well, and the <strong>-l</strong> switch to show details on all files.  Often combined with other terms: <strong>lsusb</strong> lists all the usb devices,
<strong>lsmod</strong> all the modules, etc.<br /></td>
</tr>

<tr><th colspan = "2">File management</th></tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>cp source.file destination.file</strong></td>
<td>Copy a file to another filename or location.  Use the <strong>-R</strong> switch ("recursive") to copy entire directories.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>mv source.file destination.file</strong></td>
<td>Move a file or directory from one location to another.  Also used to rename files or
directories and to make a backup, for example before changing a critical file such as <strong>xorg.conf</strong>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>rm deleteme.file</strong></td>
<td>Delete a file.  Use the <strong>-R</strong> switch to delete a directory, and the <strong>-f</strong> switch ("force") if you don't want to
be prompted to confirm each deletion.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>cat file.txt</strong></td>
<td>Prints the contents of a file on the screen.  Only use on text files.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>grep</strong></td>
<td>Find a given string of characters in a given piece of text, and print the entire line it was on.  Usually used
with a pipe, e.g. <strong>cat somefile.txt &#124; grep <em>somestring</em></strong> will display the line from somefile.txt that contains &rdquo;somestring&rdquo;.  To find a network usb card, for instance, you could type: <strong>lsusb &#124; grep network</strong>. The grep command is case sensitive by default, use the <strong>-i</strong> switch to make it case-insensitive.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>most</strong></td>
<td>More sophisticated file viewer, which features one screenful at a time, up and down scrolling, text searching, line numbers, and other things.  Often used in a pipe, for instance <strong>cat somefile.txt &#124; most</strong>. NOTE: this replaces <strong>less</strong> as the default pager in MEPIS Linux.</td>
</tr>

<tr><th colspan = "2">Symbols</th></tr>

<tr>
<td> <strong> &#124; </strong> </td>
<td>The pipe symbol, used to send the output of one command into the input of another.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong> &gt;</strong> </td>
<td>The redirect symbol, used to send the output of a command into a file or device.  Doubling the redirect symbol will cause the output to be added to the end of an existing file rather than replacing it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>&amp;</strong></td>
<td>Adding the ampersand to the end of a command (with a space before it) causes it to run in the background, so that you don't have to wait for it to complete to issue the next command. </td>
</tr>
</table>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s06-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>For most new Linux users, the command line is mainly used as a troubleshooting tool.  Terminal commands give quick, detailed information that can be easily pasted into a forum post, search box, or email when seeking help on the web.  Here are some common troubleshooting commands. Some of them may not output information, or not as much information unless you are <a href="index.html#s12-1_rootuser " class="spterm"  title="see glossary for &ldquo;root user&rdquo;">logged in as root</a>.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>lspci</strong></td>
<td>Shows a quick summary of detected internal hardware devices.  If a devices shows as <em>unknown</em>, you usually have
a driver issue.  The <strong>-v</strong> switch causes more detailed information to be displayed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>lsusb</strong></td>
<td>Lists attached usb devices.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>dmesg</strong></td>
<td>Shows the system log for the current session (i.e. since you last booted).   The output is quite long, and
usually this is piped through <strong>grep</strong>, <strong>less</strong> (similar to <strong>most</strong>) or <strong>tail</strong> (to see what happened most recently). 
For example, to find potential errors related to your network hardware, try <strong>dmesg &#124; grep -i net</strong>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>ifconfig</strong></td>
<td>Shows the status of currently active network interfaces.  See <a href="index.html#section05-6-1-1">Section 5.6.1</a>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>iwconfig</strong></td>
<td>Shows the status of your wireless network interface.  See <a href="index.html#section05-6-1-2">Section 5.6.1.2</a>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>top</strong></td>
<td>Provides a real-time list of running processes and various statistics about them.  </td>
</tr>
</table>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s06-1_doc">Accessing documentation for commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Many commands will print out a simple "usage information" message when you use the &ldquo;--help&rdquo; or &ldquo;-h&rdquo; switch.  This can be helpful for quickly recalling the syntax of a command. For example:
<pre>
cp --help
</pre>
</li>
<li>For more detailed information on how to use a command, consult the command's <strong>man page</strong>.   Short for &#8220;manual,&#8221; man pages typically contain detailed information about switches, arguments, and sometimes the inner workings of a command.  Even GUI programs often have man pages, detailing available command line options.
</li>
<li> Manual pages are conveniently viewed in Dolphin by typing <strong>man:commandname</strong>
into the address bar.  In addition, by simply typing <strong>man:/</strong> into Dolphin, you can browse the entire collection of man
pages installed by MEPIS.
</li>

<li>The man page may also be read at the console with the command <strong>man <em>commandname</em></strong>.  By default, man pages are displayed
in the terminal's <strong>most</strong> pager, meaning that only one screenful of the file is displayed at a time.
 Keep these tricks in mind to navigate the resulting screen:
<ul> <!-- sublist -->
<li>The space bar advances the screen.</li>
<li>The letter <strong>b</strong> moves the screen backward.</li>
<li>The letter <strong>q</strong> exits the help document.</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist -->

<h1 id="section07-1">7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Management</h1>

<h2>7.1: Introduction</h2>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Synaptic is the recommended method for beginners to manipulate software packages, although other methods are also available and may be
required for certain situations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href ="index.html#section07-2">7.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synaptic Package Manager</a></li>
<li><a href= "index.html#section07-3">7.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other methods</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s07-1_packages" >Packages</h3>
<p>Installing, removing, and upgrading software on MEPIS is accomplished through the Advanced Package Tool (<strong>APT</strong>) system.   Software
is provided in the form of a <strong>package</strong>, a discrete, non-executable bundle of data that includes instructions for your package manager
about installation.  They are stored on servers called <strong>repositories</strong>, and can be browsed, downloaded, and installed through special
client software called a <strong>package manager</strong>.  The recommended package manager for MEPIS is Synaptic (see <a href="index.html#section07-2"> Section 7.2</a>), though the graphical utility Gdebi and the command-line utility apt-get are also included for those who prefer them (see <a href= "index.html#section07-3"> Section 7.3</a>).</p>

<p>The majority of packages have one or more <strong>dependencies</strong>, meaning that they have one or more packages that must also be
installed in order for them to work.  The APT system is designed to automatically handle dependencies for you; in other words, when you
try to install a package whose dependencies aren't already installed, your APT package manager will automatically mark those dependencies
for installation as well.</p>


<br />

<h3 id="s07-1_repo">Repositories</h3>
<p>APT <a href="index.html#s12-1_repo" class="spterm"  title="click to go to the Glossary">repositories (repos)</a> are much more
than just web sites with downloadable software.  The packages on repository sites are specially organized and indexed to be accessed through
a <a href="index.html#s12-1_package-man" class="spterm"  title="click to go to the Glossary">package manager,</a> rather
than browsed directly. MEPIS Linux comes with a set of enabled repositories that offer you both security and choice.  If you are new to
MEPIS (and especially if you are new to Linux), it is recommended that in general you stick with the default repositories at first, with the exception of the multimedia repository that you will need to enable for proprietary-format codecs  (see <a href="index.html#section08-02">Section 8.2</a>). </p>

<p>For security reasons, these repositories are digitally signed, meaning that packages are authenticated with an encryption key to make sure they are authentic. If you install packages from non-Debian repos without the key, you will get a warning that they could not be authenticated.  To get rid of this warning and make sure your installations are secure, you need to install any keys not installed by default; see if the repo contains a keyring package, or check its home page for instructions on adding the key. Most repositories should have a <em>keyring</em> package which installs the necessary keys (search <em>keyring</em> in Synaptic).  Here are the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>gnome-keyring </li>
<li>debian-archive-keyring </li>
<li>debian-multimedia-keyring </li>
</ul>

<p>The MEPIS Community has its own repository of packages that it builds and maintains.  These packages are distinct from official MEPIS packages, and typically have been <a href="index.html#s12-1_backport" class="spterm" id="backport" title="click to go to the Glossary">backported</a> from Debian versions that are still in testing or even experimental.  To find out more about what is available, who the packagers are, and even how to get involved, follow the MEPIS Community Package Project link below.</p>

<p>Repositories are most easily added, removed, or edited through Synaptic, though they can also be altered by hand by editing the file <strong>/etc/atp/sources.list</strong> in a root terminal. In Synaptic, click <strong>Settings >Repositories</strong>, then click the button New and add the information.  Here, for instance, is how the settings look for the MEPIS Community repo:</p>
<img src="grafx/CommRepoSyn_small.png" alt="Synaptic community repo" width="400" height="93" />

<p>Some repositories carry special labels:  </p>
<ul>
<li><u>contrib</u>, which depend on or are accessory to non-free packages.</li>
<li><u>non-free</u>, which do not meet the Debian free software guidelines (DFSG).</li>
<li><u>security</u>, which contain security-related updates only.</li> 
<li><u>backports</u>, which contain packages from newer versions of Debian that have been backwards compiled for Debian 5.0 
(&ldquo;Lenny,&rdquo; the version SimplyMEPIS is built with) to keep your OS up-to-date.</li>
<li><u>mepis</u>, which contain the special packages that make MEPIS what it is.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />


<h2 id="s07-1_tips">Tips</h2>
<ul><li>Be sure to have only one package manager open at a time, or you will get an error message.</li>
<li>MEPIS Linux is binary-compatible with DEBIAN Lenny (codename for the current stable release).  This means that software compiled to run on Lenny should be able to be run without
modification on MEPIS Linux.  Adding repositories or installing packages designed for newer versions of Debian, Ubuntu, or Ubuntu
derivatives (including SimplyMEPIS 6.x) may cause system instability.
</li>

<li>In addition to dependencies, packages can also specify <em>suggests</em> and <em>recommends</em>.  <strong>Recommends</strong>, unlike
&ldquo;dependencies,&rdquo; are not absolutely required, but should be installed along with the package in most circumstances.
<strong>Suggests</strong> are packages that enhance or compliment the package in question, but are in no way required.  To see and/or mark
suggested or recommended packages, right-click the package and select <strong>mark suggested for install</strong> or <strong>mark
recommended for install</strong>, respectively.
</li>
<li>Click the Synaptic icon in the panel to open the application, click Mark all upgrades, and run the updates.
</li>

<li>If you plan to install software using methods other than APT (for instance, to get a newer version), make sure you <em>purge</em> any
versions that have been installed using Synaptic (right-click, <strong>Mark for Complete Removal</strong>) or apt-get in a terminal (type
<strong>dpkg --help</strong> for information).  Since non-repository installations often put files in different locations than repository
installations, failing to remove the repository version can cause two conflicting versions to be installed side-by-side.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li><u>Should you uninstall?</u>:  Occasionally, conflicts in package dependencies can cause the APT system to require the uninstallation of  a
large number of important packages in order to install some other package.  This is rare with the default configuration, but becomes
increasingly likely as you add unsupported repositories.  <strong>BE VERY ATTENTIVE</strong> whenever installing a package would require
that others be removed!  If a large number of packages are going to be removed, you may want to investigate another method of installing
this application.
</li>
<li><u>Should you keep?</u>:  When upgrading, you will often be informed that a new configuration file is available for a certain package,  and be asked
whether you want to install the new version (a.k.a. &ldquo;the package maintainer's version&rdquo;) or keep your current version.  The
safest answer to this question is usually <strong>keep the current version</strong> (<strong>N</strong>), which is also the default choice. 
If the package in question is from a MEPIS Linux repository, however, it is recommended that you say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; <strong>(Y)</strong> instead.

<!-- ########################### SECTION 07-2  ########################### -->



<h1 id="section07-2">7.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synaptic Software Package Manager</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Synaptic is a friendly, easy-to-use frontend (GUI) to the APT <a href="index.html#s12-1_package-man" class="spterm" 
title="click to go to the Glossary"> package management </a> system.  It is a graphical tool which allows you to install,
remove, upgrade, or get information on all the software packages available in the online repositories on your repository list
(<strong>/etc/apt/sources.list</strong>).  Synaptic can be launched from <strong>Start Menu > System > Synaptic Package
Manager</strong>, or you can simply click on the <strong>Synaptic</strong> icon in the panel.  Note that your root
password is required in order to install or remove software; and naturally, if you want to use the online repositories (as opposed to the CD
or DVD), you will need to be connected to the Internet.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="s07-2_installing">Installing new software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Here are the basic steps for installing software in Synaptic:</p> 

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.
</li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Reload</strong> button.  This button causes Synaptic to contact the online repository servers and download a new
<em>index</em> file with information on what packages are available, what versions they are, and what other packages are required for them
to be installed.
</li>
<li>If you already know the name of the package you are looking for, just click in the pane on the right and start typing, and Synaptic will incrementally search for what you type. 
</li> 
<li>If you don't know the package's name, use the <strong>Search</strong> button to locate software based on name or keywords.  This is one of Synaptic's greatest advantages over other methods.
</li>
<li>Alternatively, click the <strong>Sections</strong> button on the bottom left and browse through the one that interests you (Editors, Games and Amusement, Utilities, etc.).  You will see a description of each package in the bottom pane, and can use the tabs to discover more information about it.
</li>
<li>Click the empty box next to it and select <strong>Mark for Installation</strong>.  If the package has dependencies, you will be notified and they will automatically be marked for installation as well.  You can also just double-click the package if it is the only one you are installing.
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to begin the installation.  You will see a warning message &#8220;You are about to install software that can't be authenticated!&#8221; that you can safely ignore.
</li>  
<li>There may be additional steps: just follow the prompts as you receive them until the installation completes.
</li>
<li>Occasionally, packages will fail to install because their install scripts fail one or more <em>safety
checks;</em> for instance, a package might try to overwrite a file that is part of another package, or require downgrading another package
due to dependencies.  If you have an install or upgrade that is stuck on one of these errors, it is called a <em>broken package</em>.  To fix this, click on the <strong>Custom</strong> button on the bottom of the left panel, then the entry <em>Broken.</em>  Highlight the package and try first to fix the problem by clicking <strong>Edit >Fix Broken Packages</strong>.  If that is not successful, then right-click the package to uninstall it.
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-2_upgrading">Upgrading software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Synaptic enables you to quickly and conveniently keep your system up-to-date.</p>  

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.
</li> 
<li>Synaptic will inform you if any packages are upgradeable by marking them with a star.  You can also click the <strong>Status</strong> button on the bottom left and select the <em>Installed (upgradeable)</em> section in the left pane to see all the upgradeable packages installed on your system.
</li>  
<li>Click the <strong>Mark All Upgrades</strong> button to select all of these packages for upgrade, or click on the packages one-by-one to individually select upgrades. 
</li> 
<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to begin the upgrade, ignoring the warning message.  As the installation process begins, you have the option of watching the details in a terminal within Synaptic.
</li>
<li>With some package upgrades, you may be asked to confirm a dialog, enter configuration information, or decide whether or not to
overwrite a configuration file you have altered.  Pay attention here, and follow the prompts until the upgrade completes.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="s07-2_downgrading">Downgrading software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may want to downgrade an application to an older version, for instance because of problems that arose with the new one.  This is easy to do in Synaptic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.</li>
<li>Click on Installed in the panel on the left, then find and highlight the package you want to downgrade in the panel on the right</li>
<li>On the menu bar, click <strong>Package >Force version...</strong></li>
<li>Select from the available versions on the pull-down list</li>
<li>Click Force Version, then install in the usual manner.</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-2_pinning">Pinning software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may want to <em>pin</em> an application to a specific version to keep it from being upgraded in order to avoid problems with more recent ones.  This is easy to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.
</li>
<li>Click on Installed in the panel on the left, then find and highlight the package you want to pin in the panel on the right.
</li>
<li>On the menu bar, click <strong>Package >Lock version...</strong>
</li>
<li>Synaptic will highlight the package in red and add a lock icon to the first column.
</li>
<li>To unlock, highlight the package again and click Package >Lock version (which will have a check mark).
</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: this pinning only affects the application Synaptic, not the actual list of application versions used by Apt, and will not work if you later use another upgrade means.  For a universal pinning method, follow the example linked below.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-2_removing">Removing software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Removing software from your system with Synaptic seems as straightforward as installing, but there is more to it than meets the eye:</p> 
 
<ul>
<li>To remove a package, simply right-click it and select <strong>Mark for Removal</strong> or <strong>Mark for Complete Removal</strong>.

<ul> <!-- sublist -->
<li><strong>Removal</strong> uninstalls the software, but leaves configuration files in case you want to keep your settings.
</li>  
<li><strong>Complete Removal</strong> removes the software and the configuration files as well (this is known as <em>purging</em> a package).
</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist -->

<li>When you have other programs that depend on the package being removed, those packages will have to be removed as well.   This usually happens when you remove software libraries (packages starting with &ldquo;lib&rdquo;), services, or command-line applications that serve as  <a
href="index.html#s12-1_backend" class="spterm"  title="program you don't directly run, but access via a frontend"> back-ends</a> to other
applications.  <em>Make sure you read carefully</em> the summary Synaptic gives you before clicking <strong>OK</strong>.
</li>
<li>Removing large applications that are composed of many packages can bring complications.   Many times these packages are installed using
a <strong>meta-package</strong>, which is an empty package that simply depends on all the packages you need for the application.  The best way to
remove a complicated package like this is to inspect the dependency list for the meta-package, and remove the packages listed there.  Take
care, however, that you don't uninstall a dependency of another application you want to keep!
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section07-3">7.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing Software by Other Methods</h1>
<h2 id="s07-3_deb">Deb packages</h2>
<p>The software packages installed through Synaptic (and APT behind it) are in a format called <em>deb</em> (short for &ldquo;Debian&rdquo;,
the Linux distribution that devised APT). You can manually install deb packages using the graphical tool <strong>Gdebi-kde</strong> or
the command-line tool <strong>gdebi</strong>.  This is a simple tool to install local deb packages.</p>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-3_gdebi">Installing .deb files with Gdebi-kde</h2>
<ol>
<li>Click on the deb package you want to install.  Gdebi-kde will open the install dialog.</li>

<li>Click <strong>Install.</strong></li>

<li>You will be prompted for your root password.  Enter it to proceed.</li>

<li>Gdebi will attempt to install the package, and report the results.</li>

</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-3_dpkg">Installing deb files with gdebi</h2>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; gdebi is a LOCAL installer/de-installer package. It does not work over the internet like synaptic or apt-get. gdebi can only install a .deb that has already been downloaded to the system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Konsole from <strong>Start Menu > System > Konsole (Terminal)</strong>.   Become root using the <strong>su</strong> command and entering the root password when prompted.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>cd</strong> command to change to the directory containing your downloaded .deb file(s).  (Sometimes it is easier to first navigate to the directory containing the deb file(s), hit F4 to open a terminal, and change to root.)
<br /></li>

<li>Install the package with the command (substituting the real package name, of course): 
<pre>
gdebi -i packagename.deb
</pre>
If you are installing multiple packages at the same time, you can do it all at once using:
<pre>
dpkg -i *.deb
</pre> 
NOTE: In a shell command, the asterisk is a <em>wild card</em> in the argument. In this case it will cause the program to apply the command to
any file whose name ends with &ldquo;.deb&rdquo;.</li>

<li>If required dependencies are not installed on your system already, you will get <em>unmet dependencies errors</em> as
<strong>gdebi</strong> does not automatically take care of them.  To correct these errors and finish the installation, run
<pre>
apt-get -f install
</pre>
Apt-get will attempt to rectify the situation by either installing the needed dependencies (if they are available from
the repositories), or removing your .deb files (if the dependencies cannot be installed).
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-3_more">More install methods</h2>
<p>Sooner or later some software that you want to install will not be available in the repositories and you  may need to use other
installation methods.  These methods include: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>RPM packages:</strong> Some distributions of Linux use the RPM packaging system (short for RedHat Package Manager, developed by
RedHat Linux. RPM packages are similar to <em>deb</em> packages in many ways, and there is a command-line program available from MEPIS Linux to
convert RPM packages to <em>debs</em> called <strong>alien</strong>.   Alien does not come installed with MEPIS Linux, but is available
from the default repositories.
<br />
After you have installed alien on your system, you can use it to install an rpm package with this command (as root): 
<pre>
alien -i packagename.rpm
</pre>  
That will place a deb file with the same name in the location of the rpm file that you can then install as described above. For more detailed information on alien, see the internet version of its <em>man page</em>  in the Links and Guides section at the bottom of
this page.
</li>

<li id="s07-3_source">
<strong>Source code:</strong> Any open-source program can be compiled from the programmer's original source code if there is no other option. In ideal circumstances, this is actually a pretty simple operation, but sometimes you can run into errors that require a little more skill to sort through. Source is usually distributed as a <em>tarball</em> (tar.gz or tar.bz2 file).  See the Links and Guides section for a tutorial on compiling programs.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Many software developers package software in their own custom ways, usually  distributed as tarballs or zip files. They may contain setup scripts, ready-to-run binaries, or binary installer programs similar to Windows &ldquo;setup.exe&rdquo; programs. In Linux, such programs often end in &ldquo;.bin&rdquo;.  GoogleEarth, for example, is often distributed this way.  When in doubt, consult the installation instructions provided with the software.  If you have to compile a package, consult the MEPIS Wiki article below.

<h2 id="s08-01_bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
<p><em>See also <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8: Bluetooth</a></em></p>
<p>Bluetooth provides a means to connect and exchange information between personal devices such as mobile phones, laptops,  digital cameras, etc., over a secure short-range radio frequency.  Installing <strong>kdebluetooth</strong> through the repos provides many basic tools (see <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8</a>) that are available by right-clicking the Bluetooth icon on the right side of the panel and are mostly self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>Object transfer</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: object transfer is broken in MEPIS, but the following directions will help you once it is active again.</p>

<p>Various applications can use Bluetooth to pass objects (files, pictures, vCal entries, vCards, etc.) between devices, though some work better than others and success depends a lot on the particular device.  All rely on the Object Exchange protocol (OBEX), a kind of binary HTTP optimized for ad-hoc wireless links that is built in on many devices like PDAs and mobile phones.</p>

<p>OBEX Client (kbtobexclient) is installed with kdebluetooth, and easily used from the host computer or the device:</p>

<ul> <!-- start  primary list-->
<li>From the host computer:
<ul> <!-- start sub-list-->
<li>Pair the device with the host computer (see <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8</a>) if not already done.
</li>
<li>Right-click the Bluetooth icon and select <strong>Send file...</strong>.
</li> 
<li>A screen will open up, showing your home directory in the upper half, and  in the lower half any Bluetooth devices it has found after searching.
</li>  
<li>Locate and drag any file(s) you want to transfer to the lower right portion of the screen, click on the device name if necessary, and click <strong>Send</strong>. 
</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sub-list-->

<li>From the device:
<ul> <!-- start sub-list-->
<li>Pair the device with the host computer (see <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8</a>) if not already done.
</li>
<li>Before initiating transfer, click on the Bluetooth icon on the host computer, then on the device name to connect them.  You will see a pop-up notification that the connection has been made.
</li>
<li>Initiate transfer on the device by the appropriate means.  For example, on a Palm PDA, you navigate to the object you want to transfer, tap to highlight it, click Send, and select Bluetooth.
</li>
<li>Look for a dialog box, perhaps minimalized, on the host computer.
</li>
<li>Click the pull-down menu on the dialog box (below the field with the object(s) to transfer), and select to allow transfer automatically.  Then click OK to transfer the object, and select the location where you want it.

<h2 id="s08-06_files">Folders and Files</h2>
<p>MEPIS Linux comes with a powerful graphical program to manage files and folders called Dolphin, the default file manager and file viewer for KDE4. There is also a command-line program available from the repos called Midnight Commander that uses the entire terminal screen.
Each has its advantages, depending on your preferences and the task you need to accomplish.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dolphin:&nbsp;</strong> as a File Manager is reached most easily by clicking the icon on the left side of the panel at the bottom of the screen.  Note that by default Dolphin does <em>not</em> show hidden system files (the ones that start with a dot such as <strong>.mozilla</strong>); to change that, click <strong>View > Show Hidden Files</strong>.

<p><em>See also <a href="index.html#section05-0">Section 5:&nbsp; Configuration</a></em></p>


<h2 id="s08-07_findfile">Finding files and folders</h2>

<p>A number of powerful means of finding files or folders, both graphical and command-line, are available for MEPIS Linux.</p>

<h4>GUI:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>KRunner</strong> is a powerful search tool, available simply by pressing Alt+F2.  See section 5.3.</li>
<li>
<strong>KFind:&nbsp;</strong> This graphical search program can be reached by clicking <strong>Start Menu > Find Files/Folders</strong>.  You can search by name, location, contents or properties.
<br />
KFind handbook: open the application and click the Help button.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>CLI:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>locate:&nbsp;</strong> A command-line tool that can be installed from the repos.  For each given pattern, <strong>locate</strong> searches one or more databases of file names and displays the ones that contain the pattern. For example, typing:
<pre>
locate firefox
</pre>
will return an extremely long list with every single file that has the word &ldquo;firefox&rdquo; in its name or in its path. This command is best used when the <em>exact</em> file name is known.
<br />
<br />

<br /><br />
</li>

<li>
<strong>whereis:&nbsp;</strong> Another command-line tool, installed by default.  For each given pattern, <strong>whereis</strong> searches one or more databases of file names and displays the file names that contain the pattern, but it ignores paths so the return list is much shorter. For example, typing:
<pre>
whereis firefox
</pre> 
will return a much shorter list something like this: 
<pre>
firefox: /usr/bin/firefox /etc/firefox /usr/lib/firefox \
         /usr/X11R6/bin/firefox /usr/bin/X11/firefox \
         /usr/share/firefox /usr/share/man/man1/firefox.1.gz

<li>
<strong>which:</strong> Another command-line tool available by default.  For the given pattern, <strong>which</strong> attempts to identify the
executable. For example, typing:
<pre>
which firefox

<h2 id="s08-07_listhw"> How to list  your hardware </h2>
<p>For configuration you will probably need to discover exactly what hardware is connected to your system. Use one of the following methods.</p>
<h4>Basic list</h4>
<p>One good place to get information about your hardware is Kinfocenter.  Click <strong>Start Menu > System > KInfo Center (Info Center)</strong>, and you will see the list of hardware in the left panel, and details in the right.</p>
<h4>Detailed list</h4>
<p>You can get more detailed information using a command-line program that comes pre-installed with MEPIS.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a terminal and type <a class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_rootuser " title="see Glossary for &ldquo;root user&rdquo;">as root:</a> <strong>hwinfo</strong> to see a detailed list of hardware. If you run the command as an ordinary user, you may get less information.
</li>

<li>You can copy and paste this list into a document. Or you can redirect the output to a plain text document by typing this as root:
<pre>
hwinfo > /home/username/Documents/hwlist
</pre>
</li>

<h2  id="s08-07_kill">Killing runaway programs</h2>
<p>When a program refuses to end, you can kill it in a number of ways.  Here are two of the most common:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Desktop:&nbsp;</strong>
<ul><!-- sublist -->
<li>
Press <strong>Ctrl-Esc</strong>, which brings up KDE System Guard.  Locate the program you want to stop by scrolling through the list or using the search box, highlight it, and click Kill Process.
</li>
<li>
Press <strong>Ctrl-Alt-Esc</strong> to change the cursor into a skull and crossbones.  Click on any open program to kill it. This xkill
program can also be launched from the command line:
<pre>
xkill
</pre>
</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist -->

<li>
<strong>Terminal:&nbsp;</strong>: Press <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>, which will usually stop a program you started in a terminal
session.
<br />
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s08-07_symlink">Symbolic links</h2>
<p>A symbolic link (also soft link or symlink) is a special kind of file that points to another file,  much like a shortcut in Windows or an
alias in Macintosh. A symbolic link does not contain any actual data (as a hard link does), it just points to another file somewhere in the
system. </p>
<p>There are two ways to create a symlink: Dolphin or the command line.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dolphin:&nbsp;</strong>  Navigate to the file or folder (target of the link) that you want to use under another name, then use the split screen icon to open another Dolphin window and navigate to where you want the symlink to be located.  Drag the target to the symlink location.  A box will open with choices to <strong>Move Here, Copy Here,</strong> or <strong>Link Here.</strong> Select <strong>Link Here</strong>  and you're done! Name it however you want, and you have a symbolic link to the target file &mdash;which is still in its original location.</li>

<li>
<strong>Command line:</strong>   Open a terminal and type:
<pre>
ln -s TargetFile LinkName
</pre>
Be sure to include full path as well as file/folder names. The <strong>-s</strong> switch indicates that a symbolic link and not a hard link (that points directly to data) is being created.

<!-- ########################### SECTION 08.08  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section08-08">8.8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Good practices </h1>

<p>This section covers the good basic practices that MEPIS Linux users should follow to keep their system efficient and secure. </p>

<h2 id="s08-08_backup">Backup</h2>
<p>The most important practice is to back up your data and configuration files regularly, a process that is easy in MEPIS Linux.  It is highly recommended that you back up to a different drive than the one your data is on! You can buy a new storage device, or use an old hard drive if you can find one.</p>

<h3>Back up data:</h3>
<p>Make sure you back up your data, including documents, graphics, music, and mail.  By default, most of this is stored in your Home directory (<strong>/home/YourUserName/</strong>).</p>
<br />

<h3>Back up configuration files:</h3>

<p>Here is a list of items for backup:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/home:&nbsp;</strong> Holds most of the personal configuration files.</li>
<li><strong>/root:&nbsp;</strong> Holds the changes you have made as root.</li>
<li><strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf:&nbsp;</strong> (X configuration file).</li>
<li><strong>/etc/apt/sources.list:&nbsp;</strong> (apt sources file).</li>
<li><strong>/boot/grub/menu.lst:&nbsp;</strong> (Grub menu file).</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h3>Back up a list of installed program packages:</h3>
<p>It's also a good idea to save in your  /home/<em>username</em>
directory a file that contains the list of programs that you have installed with Synaptic, apt-get or Gdebi (see <a href="index.html#section07-1"> Section 7:     Software Management </a>). If in the future you need to reinstall, you'll just have to paste the names of the files to an <strong>apt-get install</strong> command. You can create an inventory of all packages on your system installed since installation with:</p>

<pre>dpkg --get-selections &gt;list_packages.txt
</pre>

<p>To reinstall ALL those packages at once: </p>

<pre>dpkg --set-selections &lt;list_packages.txt
apt-get update
apt-get dselect-upgrade
</pre>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s08-08_keep">Back up using <em>Keep</em></h2>

<p><strong>Keep</strong> and <strong>LuckyBackup</strong> are graphical front ends for <strong>Rdiff-Backup</strong> that functions as a backup system for KDE.  Both are available from the repos (enable the Community repo for LuckyBackup).</p>

<p>To back up using <strong>Keep,</strong> follow these steps:</p>


<ul>
<li>MEPIS Wiki: Backup: <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/Backup"> http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/Backup</a></li>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s08-08_cloning">Disk cloning</h2>
<p>As a precaution in case of complete harddisk failure, some users create a complete image of their harddrive, a technique called <em>disk
cloning</em> or <em>ghosting.</em> In case a new harddrive must be installed, the user can simply restore the entire image to be back in
operation in a few minutes. Open-source (e.g., Partimage, G4L) and proprietary (e.g., Acronis) ghosting software are available to
carry out this procedure.  Depending on the software used, you may have to carry this out from a separate drive or a LiveCD. </p>

<p>Cloning can also be used to make an identical working copy of your hard disk or partition to a second disk or partition with an equal or larger size than the original by using the command line tool dd. Unlike the cloning tools listed above, dd copies the hard disk or partition on a sector by sector basis, so everything is copied, including unused sectors. That being the case, it can take some time for larger drives.</p>

<br />


<h2 id="s08-08_unneeded">Remove unneeded services</h2>
<p>It's a good idea to remove services that start at boot time and you don't need both to improve security and to limit resources
utilization.  To stop a program, for example called <strong>UnneededProgram</strong> from starting, execute this command as
root:</p>
<pre>
update-rc.d -f UnneededProgram remove
</pre>

<p>Here is a list of services that you might not need (check!):</p>
<ul>
<li>spamassassin:  e-mail spam filter.</li>
<li>hpoj: HP Office Jet printer driver.</li>
<li>cupsys:  Common UNIX Printing System(tm).</li>
<li>ntpdate:  Set system time from internet NTP servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also the KDE Service Configuration application for configuring other services, found by clicking <strong>Start Menu > Settings > System Settings > Advanced tab > Service Manager</strong>.  The Service Manager module displays a static list of services that are started on demand and cannot be modified, and a second list of services that can be loaded when KDE starts or manually started when needed.  You can also install <strong>KSysV</strong> from the repos for more advanced control of the startup scripts.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s08-08_disk-maintenance">Disk maintenance</h2>
<p>It is rare that you will need to do much disk maintenance compared to  Windows, since Linux operating systems and the disk filesystems they utilize are  designed differently. Still, there may come a moment when you want to check for partition/disk errors, something done in Windows with <strong>scandisk.</strong> To check for filesystem and disk read/write errors, go through the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > Settings > MEPIS System Assistant</strong>, and supply the root password.
</li>
<li>Click on the tab Repair Partition.
</li>
<li>When run from within the installed operating system, the Assistant will only test the drive.
</li>  
<li>If you want to actually repair problems, you need to run the System Assistant after booting from the LiveCD and choose <strong>bad
blocks.</strong> The Assistant will ask you interactively if you want to repair problems it uncovers.
</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: The act of defragmenting or &ldquo;defragging&rdquo; a drive, so well known in Windows&reg;, is ordinarily unneeded in MEPIS Linux as long as you have a standard Linux <a class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_filesystem " title="see Glossary for &ldquo;filesystem&rdquo;">filesystem</a> such as <em>ext3</em>, <em>ext4</em> or <em>ReiserFS.</em></p>
<br />
<br />


<h2 id="s08-08_upgradeprecautions">Upgrade precautions</h2>
<p>These are some time-tested rules of thumb for new users of MEPIS Linux to avoid getting into trouble when upgrading their software:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always read the prompts carefully.
</li>
<li>Use the recommended URLs in your <strong>sources.list</strong> of software repositories.
</li>
<li>If upgrading in a terminal, use <strong>upgrade</strong>. Never use <strong>dist-upgrade</strong> or <strong>smart
upgrade</strong>.
</li>
<li>When given the choice between the maintainer's config file and what's on your system, take the time to consider the options.  If you have no other idea, then accept system changes coming from the MEPIS development source, but keep your current one for all others.
</li>
<li>Sometimes packages are held back because they need to install or upgrade additional packages to be upgraded.  Other times they are held back because they will uninstall large portions of your system if you install them.  If you can't figure out the reason, it is better to leave them alone.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s09-2_programming">Programming tools</h2>

<h3>C and C++</h3>
<p>The GNU C compiler, gcc,  is included in MEPIS Linux by default.  The GNU C++ compiler is available from the repositories in  the
<em>g++</em> package;  a number of other C and C++ compilers are also available.  The Kdevelop IDE, while it supports several
languages, was written with C++ and C  in mind.  Install it from the repositories with the <em>kdevelop</em> package.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>MEPIS Linux ships with the Sun Java 6.07 runtime environment; the full developer kit can be installed by installing the
<em>sun-java6-jdk</em> package.  The Java 5 runtime environment and development kit are also available, and the GNU <em>gcj</em> Java
compiler. Newer versions for Linux are available from Sun's website.</p>

<p>The popular <strong>Eclipse</strong> IDE is available from the repositories; it can be installed by simply selecting the &ldquo;eclipse&rdquo;
package, but there are many optional add-on packages for it as well.  The BeanShell interpreted Java environment is available from the repos, and the <strong>NetBeans</strong> IDE, available free from Sun, also works on MEPIS Linux.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python 2.5 comes preinstalled on MEPIS Linux.  You can launch the interactive interpreter by typing <strong>python</strong> at the
console. Python 2.4 as well as a large selection of additional python libraries are also available from the repositories, where you will also find the <strong>eric</strong>,  <strong>idle</strong>, and <strong>boa-constructor</strong> IDEs.</p>

<h3>Mono (.NET)</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;mono&rdquo; packages in the repository provide a .NET-compatible runtime and development environment (for C#, ASP.NET, etc).  Install the  <strong>mono-2.0-devel</strong> package to get the runtime environment and development tools.  A mono IDE <strong>monodevelop</strong> is also available.</p>

<h3 id="s09-2_other">Other tools</h3>

<ul>
<li>

<strong>CVS</strong> is a version control utility available from the repositories in the <strong>cvs</strong> package.  Although there are
newer and more feature-packed version control utilities, CVS is mature and widely supported by other tools.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Glade</strong> is a GUI designer for python or C++ applications using the GTK toolkit.  It can be installed from the
repositories as <strong>glade</strong>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Qt4-designer</strong> is a GUI designer made for KDE/QT applications and available from the repos.

</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h2 id="s09-2_web-dev">Web Development</h2>
<p>MEPIS Linux does not come with default applications already installed for designing web pages, but several are available from the
repositories: </p>

<ul>

<h1 id="section09-3">9.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows&#174; programs under MEPIS Linux</h1>

<p><em>See also <a href="index.html#section09-4">9.4:&nbsp; Virtual machines</a></em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is a certain number of applications, both open-source and commercial, that will allow Windows applications to run under MEPIS Linux.  They are referred to as emulators, meaning that they duplicate the functions of Windows on a Linux platform.  Many MS Office applications, games and other programs can be run using an emulator with varying degrees of success ranging from near-native speed and functionality to only basic performance.</p>

<h2 id="s09-3_open">Open-source</h2>

<p><strong>Wine</strong> is the primary open-source Windows emulator for MEPIS Linux.  It is a kind of compatibility layer for running  Windows programs, but does not require Microsoft Windows&#174; to run the applications.  New Wine versions are rapidly packaged by Community members and made available on the MEPIS Community forum and then in the Community Repository.</p>

<h1 id="section09-4">9.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtual machines</h1>

<p><em>See also <a href="index.html#section09-3">9.3 Emulators</a></em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Virtual machine applications are a class of programs that simulate a "virtual computer" in memory, allowing you to install any operating
system on the machine.  It is useful for testing, running non-native applications, and providing users the feeling of having a machine of
their own.  Many MEPIS Linux users make use of virtual machine software to run Microsoft Windows &ldquo;in a window&rdquo; to seamlessly
provide access to software written for Windows on their desktop.  It is also used for testing to avoid installation.</p>

<h2 id="s09-4_apps">Applications</h2>
<p>A number of virtual machine software applications for Linux exist, both open-source and proprietary.  MEPIS makes it particularly easy to use VirtualBox, so we will focus on that here.  For details and the most recent developments, see the MEPIS Wiki and MEPIS Community Virtual Machines/Emulators forum linked below.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the basic steps to set up and run VirtualBox:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare the machine</strong> -- You will need some packages before you can install and run VirtualBox.  Open a terminal, become root, and type or paste in these commands one at a time:
<pre>m-a prepare</pre>
</li>

<li><strong>Install VirtualBox</strong> -- This is most easily done with the MEPIS package from the repos, but it is also possible to download from the VirtualBox website.  Be sure to reboot after installation.
</li>

<li><strong>Create a Virtual Machine</strong> -- To create a virtual machine start VirtualBox, then click the <strong>New</strong> icon on the toolbar. You will need a Windows CD or a Linux ISO.  Follow the wizard, accepting all suggested settings unless you know better--you can always change them later.  Once the machine is set up, then click on <strong>Settings >CD/DVD Rom</strong>, and check the Mount box to point to the CD or the ISO.
</li>

<li><strong>Install Guest Additions</strong> -- Be sure to install VirtualBox GuestAdditions to your Guest OS by booting into the Guest OS, then clicking <strong>Devices >Install Guest Additions</strong> and pointing toward the <strong>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</strong> that it will automatically locate.   This will allow you to enable sharing files between Guest and Host and to adjust your display in various ways so that it suits your environment and habits.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Excellent documentation is available through <em>Help</em> on the menu bar or as a PDF from the website.</p>

<h2>Traditional window managers</h2>

<p>A <a class="spterm" title="click to see glossary entry" href="index.html#s12-1_window-man">window manager</a> in Linux is essentially the component which controls the appearance of windows and provides the means by which the user can interact with them.  MEPIS Linux comes with the K Desktop Environment, or <strong>KDE</strong> for short, which provides basic desktop functions, many applications for daily needs (Kmail, Amarok, K3b, etc.), and development tools and user documentation as well.   MEPIS Linux uses KDE 3.5.10 because it is mature and stable; at some point in the future it will move to KDE 4.x, which is currently under intense development.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 09.6  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section09-6">9.6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessing other partitions </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Immediately after installing MEPIS Linux you have access to the <a href="index.html#s12-1_rootfs" class="spterm" title="Basic logical structure of all the files the operating system can access." >root filesystem</a>.  Everything you need to run MEPIS Linux is already mounted there. But you may need to take extra steps to access data elsewhere, or you might want to set up a partitioning schema that safely stores your data outside your /home directory partition. In cases like that, you may need to know how to mount partitions other than your root partition.</p>

<p><span class="bcolor">But what exactly is a partition?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Here is a good, basic definition from the Linux Documentation Project:</p>

<p class="quote"> <em>Partitioning is a means to divide a single hard drive into many logical drives. A partition is a contiguous set of blocks on a drive that are treated as an independent disk. A partition table is an index that relates sections of the hard drive and attached devices to partitions.</em></p>

<p>When you installed MEPIS Linux, it set up a root filesystem on the partition that you designated. But other partitions can be mounted to the root filesystem and so be made available to the system and its users.  </p>

<p>In general, a partition can be mounted dynamically whenever it becomes physically connected, mounted manually when you need access to it, or mounted automatically upon boot.  In terms of actual process, dynamic mounting is done by the by <strong>udev</strong> device manager, while the options for manual mounting as well as for automatic mounting at boot are governed by the configuration file <strong>/etc/fstab</strong>.  The <strong>udev</strong> device manager listens for devices being added or removed from the system, such as a USB drive, and makes them available to the system.  Usually, fstab is the only one that users might need to modify.</p>

<p>The following sections discuss these methods in more detail.</p>

<!-- ********************** Dynamic mounting with udev   **********************  -->

<h1 id="section09-6-1">9.6.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic mounting</h1>
<p>Dynamic mounting occurs when a device is plugged into the system.  Most of the time, it will allow you to have access to the device's partition without any action on your part, usually through a window opened up by KDE.  Thus, when you plug in a device (USB memory stick, camera, PDA, etc.), the window that pops up showing the contents of that device ultimate depends on dynamic mounting by <strong>udev</strong>.</p>
<p>The following description udev outlines the mounting process (edited from Wikipedia):</p>
<p class="quote"> <em>udev is a generic kernel device manager that runs as a daemon [background process] on a Linux system and listens for a new device being initialized (or a device being removed) in the system. The system provides a set of rules that match the properties of the discovered device. A matching rule will possibly name and create a device node and run configured programs to set-up and configure the device.  udev rules can match on properties like the kernel subsystem, the kernel device name, the physical location of the device, or properties like the device's serial number. Rules can also request information from external programs to name a device or specify a custom name that will always be the same, regardless of the order devices are discovered by the system.</em></p>

<p>Rarely, however, no matching occurs and the device is not made available to the system by KDE.  This may be due to a hardware problem or a udev problem.  It is easy to find out whether the device has been recognized by the system. First plug it in, then open a terminal and type:</p>
<pre>dmesg | tail</pre>
<p>If the hardware has been recognized, you should see its name and address in the output.  That means that the problem lies at the next step, and you may have to modify udev (not recommended for newbies). Search first on your device ID number (e.g., ID 03f0:2112) to see what others have done.  For guidance on writing udev rules, consult the how-to below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia: Udev: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev</a>
</li>
<li>How to write udev rules: <a href="http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html">http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html</a> 
</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />

<!-- ********************** Manual mounting   **********************  -->

<h1 id="section09-6-2">9.6.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manual mounting</h1>

<p>If you need access only on an occasional basis to a partition that is not on a device dynamically mounted, such as a partition on your HDD from another OS, you can mount it manually with a couple of graphical tools in MEPIS Linux.</p>

<h2 id="s09-6-1_dolphinmount">Dolphin</h2>
<p>Dolphin makes it very easy to mount any partitions by dragging them to the Places panel on the left side, then simply clicking on them.  Details in the MEPIS Wiki under "Dolphin."</p>

<h2 id="s09-6-2_kwikdisk">KwikDisk</h2>
<p>KwikDisk is a kicker applet that will show up in the system tray when installed (looks like stacked disks) just to the right of the taskbar.  It has a variety of uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It displays the available file devices (hard drive partitions, floppy and CD drives, etc.) along with information on their free space, type and mount point.
</li>
<li>
It allows you to easily mount and unmount drives. Just click on the partition you want to mount (e.g. sda1, sdb1, sdb2, etc.).
</li>
<li>
It is an entry for KDiskFree, a utility that measures available space.
</li> 
</ul>

<p>Again, simply click on the device that interests you to view the contents.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on KwikDisk, type <strong>man:kwikdisk</strong> into Dolphin's address bar.
</li>
<li>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on KDiskFree, type <strong>man:kdf</strong> into Dolphin's address bar.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This will work for any Linux partition, and for Windows 98, 2000 and XP as well.  You may have to provide root's password, depending on how permissions are set up.</p>

<br /><br />



<!-- ********************** Automatic mounting with fstab    **********************  -->
<h1 id="section09-6-3">9.6.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic mounting</h1>
<p>In order to set MEPIS to automatically mount another partition at boot time so that it will be accessible at all times, you will need to edit options in the <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> configuration file.  Before we get into the details, let's go over the basic structure of every line in that file:</p>
<h3>The fstab file</h3>
<p>The file /etc/fstab has two parts: permanently available devices and, starting after the comment line: &ldquo;Dynamic entries below.&rdquo;  These are partitions detected at the time you installed MEPIS Linux, but which are not integral to operating MEPIS. They may be manually mounted, per Section 9.6.2, above. When they are mounted, the settings listed in /etc/fstab will govern their placement and permissions in the root filesystem.</p>  
<p>But when you wish to change a partition from the &ldquo;occasionally mounted manually&rdquo; category to one that is automatically mounted all the time, a few changes need to be made to the /etc/fstab configuration file.</p>

<p>Here is a typical entry for the first primary partition of a main hard drive:</p>
<pre>/dev/sda1   /   ext3   defaults,noatime   1   1</pre>

<p>Each of the six elements of this entry contains information that must be presented in a specific order, as we can show with this table where the same entry is divided out into the standard categories:</p>
<table class="screen">
<tr>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Device</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Mount Point</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Filesystem</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Options</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>dump</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>fsck order</strong>]</th>
</tr>
<tr>
      <td class="nobord">/dev/sda1</td>
      <td class="nobord">/</td>
      <td class="nobord">ext3</td>
      <td class="nobord">defaults, noatime</td>
      <td class="nobord">1</td>
      <td class="nobord">1</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td class="nobord">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
      
<p>Now that the structure of the entries makes some sense, we can proceed to edit the file.</p>
<br /><br />


<h2 id="s09-6-3_automount">Automounting a partition to the root filesystem</h2>
<p>As with most Linux configuration files, editing this configuration file (see <a href="index.html#section10-3">Section 10.3</a>) can easily be done with a text editor, <em>after</em> you back up the original file.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Open the <em>Konsole</em> terminal window (<strong>Start Menu > System > Konsole (Terminal)</strong>) and type:<br />
<pre>
cp /etc/fstab ~/Backups/fstab.original
</pre>
This will copy the current /etc/fstab into your /home/username/Backups directory under the name &ldquo;fstab.original&rdquo; in case you need to restore it later. To restore it you would need to issue this command <em>as root:</em>
<pre>
cp /home/<em>username</em>/Backups/fstab.original  /etc/fstab
</pre>
Note that in the first command, you copied a system file to your personal directory using the tilde &mdash;a shorthand for &ldquo;user home directory.&rdquo; All cool.  But the command to restore a system file needs to be much more precise. In addition to issuing the command <em>as</em> the root user, you need to specify the user home directory more strictly &mdash;from the root point of view.
<br />&nbsp;
</li>

<li>To open up the current /etc/fstab in the text editor <em>kwrite</em>, with root privileges, type in konsole:
<pre>
kdesu kwrite /etc/fstab 
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Locate the line designating the partition you want to have mounted; the first column will refer to it as /dev/sd<em>xn</em> where <em>x</em> is a letter and <em>n</em> is a number. Highlight the entire line and cut it, then paste it into the upper part of the file. For example let's use /dev/sda3 as it originally appears:
<pre>
sysfs /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
# Dynamic entries below
/dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 ext2 noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2 auto noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3 auto noauto,users,exec 0 0
</pre>
For the future, when you're sober, it might be good to document your change with a comment line so you know what is what. The following is an example of the new line in place, with a comment line added:

<pre>
sysfs /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
# automatically mounted partitions
/dev/sda3   /mnt/sda3   auto   noauto,users,exec 0 0
# Dynamic entries below
/dev/sda1   /mnt/sda1   ext2   noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda2   /mnt/sda2   auto   noauto,users,exec 0 0
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> you must change the option in column 4 to <strong>auto!</strong> Do <em>not</em> alter anything in column 3, which <em>may or may not</em> already contain the word &ldquo;auto.&rdquo; Column 3 refers to filesystem type, not to mounting options. The lines should now look similar to this, with <em>only one word changed:</em>

<pre>
sysfs /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
# automatically mounted partitions
/dev/sda3   /mnt/sda3   auto   auto,users,exec 0 0
# Dynamic entries below
/dev/sda1   /mnt/sda1   ext2   noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda2   /mnt/sda2   auto   noauto,users,exec 0 0
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Check to see that the original line for the partition is missing from the bottom section of Dynamic entries, and exists only in the new, upper section. An error will result if the line designating any partition exists twice.
</li>

<li>
Save the file and exit Kwrite.  To put your changes into effect, open a terminal, become root, and type:<pre>mount -a</pre>  <p>Now fstab will be parsed and all filesystems that are set to mount at boot will be immediately mounted if they are not already.  You will find the partition mounted under <strong>/mnt</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />



<h2 id="s09-6-3_subdirectory">Automounting a partition to a subdirectory</h2>
<p>To make it more convenient, you can mount it to another location.  Let's say you want your Windows XP partition to show up as a mounted directory under /home.  Here's how:</p>  

<ol>
<li>First, create the folder where you want it to be.  Open Dolphin, right-click an empty space and click <strong>Create New >Folder...</strong> and enter <strong>XP</strong> as the name we're going to use.
</li>
<li>Open up the current /etc/fstab in the text editor kwrite, with root privileges, by typing in konsole:
<pre>
kdesu kwrite /etc/fstab 
</pre>
<p>As before, back up the file before you start working on it.</p>
</li>
<li>Locate the line in the dynamic section for the partition you want to mount in /home.  Here we will assume the original line looks like this, though yours may differ:
<pre>/dev/hda1 /mnt/hda1 /mnt/hda1 ntfs-3g defaults,noatime 0 0</pre>
</li>
<li>Cut it from the dynamic section and paste it above in the fixed section.  Then change the mount location to your new directory:
<pre>/dev/hda1 /home/UserName/XP/ ntfs-3g defaults,noatime 0 0</pre>
</li>
<li>As before, if you see the word <strong>noauto</strong> in your particular entry, you should change it to <strong>auto</strong>.
</li>
<li>Save and exit.  When you reboot, your hda1 partition's contents should show up in the &ldquo;XP&rdquo; subdirectory in your /home directory.
</li>
<li>After first boot, you may find that MEPIS has changed the ownership of the subdirectory mointpoint to &ldquo;root&rdquo;. For mounting an NTFS partition this may not be a problem, as the default NTFS mount options set the group ID to &ldquo;users&rdquo; and allow that group rw permissions. If it is an ext3 or other Linux partition, you will not have write permission. So the user named "joany" would change the ownership back with the following CLI command, using Konsole:
<pre>
su [and give root password when prompted]
chown -R joany:users /home/joany
</pre>
Check to see that you have the correct user and group owner with:
<pre>ls -l</pre>
or by checking your home directory in Dolphin using the <em>Detailed List View</em> mode.  Once it's fixed, subsequent booting does not affect the ownership.
</li>
</ol>
<br /><br />



<h2 id="s09-6-3_trouble">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h4>Windows FAT partition</h4>

<p>ALthough Windows NTFS partitions (as used in Windows 2000 and later) usually present little problem, there is sometimes difficulty with the necessary system permissions to write or delete files on a Windows FAT partition (as in Windows 98). If this seems to be the case on your computer, you'll need to insert a step after Step 4 above:</p>
<h5>Inserted Step: setting permissions when mounting a VFAT partition</h5>
<p>Set the following additional mount options for a Windows FAT partition. Note that MEPIS should already have identified it as a vfat partition in the third column, so all your changes need only be in the fourth column (bolded below):</p>

<pre>/dev/sda5 /mnt/sda5 vfat <strong>user,users,gid=disk,umask=0000,utf8=true</strong> 0 0
</pre>
<p>If you need to set something other than full read/write/execute permissions for everyone who logs into your MEPIS system, you will need to do more study before fine-tuning your mounting permissions. </p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 09.7  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section09-7">9.7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Scripts </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A script is a simple text file that can be written directly from a keyboard, and consists of a logically sequenced series of operating system commands.  The commands are handled one at a time by a command interpreter which in turn requests services from the operating system.  The default command interpreter in MEPIS is <strong>Bash</strong>.  The commands must be understandable to Bash, and command lists have been established for programming use. A  shell script is the Linux counterpart of batch programs in the Windows world.</p>
<p>Scripts are used throughout the Linux OS and applications that run on it as an economical method of executing multiple commands in an easily created and modified manner.  During boot, for instance, many scripts are invoked to start up specific processes such as printing, networking, etc.  Scripts are also used for automated processes, system administration, application extensions, user controls, etc.  Finally, users of all kinds can employ scripts for their own purposes.</p>
<h2>A simple script</h2>
<p>Let's do a very simple (and famous) script to get the basic idea. </p> 

<ul>
<li>Open the text editor KWrite (<strong>Start Menu > Utilities</strong>, and type:
<pre>#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "Good morning, world!"</pre>
All scripts open with a <strong>shebang</strong> as in the first line: it is a combination of a number sign, an exclamation point, and the path to the command interpreter--here, Bash is the interpreter and it is found in the standard location for user applications.
</li>
<li>Save that file in your home directory with the name <strong>SimpleScript.sh</strong>.
</li>
<li>Right-click the file name, select Properties, and check "Is executable" on the Permissions tab.
</li>
<li>Open a terminal and type:
<pre>sh /home/UserName/SimpleScript.sh</pre>
</li>
<li>The line "Good morning, world!" will appear on your screen.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This simple script doesn't do very much, but it does establish the principle that a simple text file can be used to send commands to control your system's behavior.</p>
<h2 id="s09-7_example">Example of a useful script</h2>
<p>Let's look at a useful script for the ordinary user that reduces all the moves involved in backing up multiple sets of files into a single keystroke.  The script below relies itself on a system script called <strong>Rdiff-backup</strong> that would need to be installed from the repos for the script to work.  It copies one directory to another, keeping a record of the differences in a special subdirectory so you can still recover files lost some time ago.  (Incidentally, Rdiff-backup uses in turn on a script called <strong>Diff</strong>.)</p>

<p>In this example, a user named &ldquo;newbie&rdquo; wants to set up a script to back up documents, music, mail and pictures from the /home directory to an external drive.</p>

<pre>1 #!/bin/bash
2 #
3 # This Rdiff-Backup script backs up to a second hard drive
4 # It must be run as root in order to mount the second hard drive
5
6 # To restore files, issue the command: cp -a /mnt/sda1/username /home
7 # To restore, but not overwrite: 
8 #     cp -a -i --reply=no /mnt/sda1/username /home
8
9 <strong># Mount the external devices</strong>
10
11 mount /dev/sdb1
12 mount /dev/sdb2
13 mount /dev/sdb3
14
15 <strong># Execute the backup</strong>
16
17 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Documents /mnt/sdb2/Documents
18 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Music /mnt/sdb1/Music
19 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Mail /mnt/sdb2/Mail
20 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Pictures /mnt/sdb3/Pictures
21 
22 <strong># Unmount the external devices</strong>
23
24 umount /dev/sdb1
25 umount /dev/sdb2
26 umount /dev/sdb3</pre>
<p>Now let's look at this script's components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines 2-7: a number sign has been placed in front of these lines (called "commenting them out") to indicate to Bash that they are not part of the sequence of commands to be executed.  Their purpose here is to provide anyone who looks at this script with information about such things as the script's origin, creator, purpose, and license (metadata).
</li>
<li>Line 9: good scripts separate the commands into clearly labelled procedural sections, bolded here and in lines 15 and 22.
</li>
<li>Lines 11-13: the three devices to be used for the backup have to first be mounted so they are available to the system.
</li>
<li>Lines 17-20: here bash is told to use the system script rdiff-backup to compare the original directories (sources) with the backup directories (targets), copy over the differences it finds, and keep a record of the changes.
</li>
<li>Lines 24-26: once the backup work is done, the external drives are unmounted from the system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone who wanted to use such a script would have to carry out a few execution steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy the whole script.
</li>
<li>Right-click the desktop and select <strong>Create New >Text file...</strong>
</li>
<li>Give the file a name that makes sense (no spaces, though), and add the "sh" extension so you will recognize it is a script.  For this example, you might select <strong>Backup_DocsMusicMailPictures.sh</strong>
</li>
<li>Open the new text file and paste in the script.
</li>
<li>Change any names, locations, etc. to what they are on your particular system.  In the example above, you may well have different names and/or locations for the directories to be backed up, and different devices where they are supposed to go.
</li>
<li>Save that script in a place you can easily find it when you need it, let's say you make a new directory <strong>/home/scripts</strong> for it.
</li>
<li>Right-click the script, select Properties, click on the Permissions tab, and check the <strong>Is executable</strong> box and click OK.
</li>
<li>When you are ready to backup, open a terminal and type:
<pre>sh /home/scripts/Backup_DocsMusicMailPictures.sh</pre>
<p>Hint: use the tab key to autocomplete the file name after you type the first few letters.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.0  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-0">10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Hood</h1>

<h2>10.0: Introduction</h2>

<p>Users coming from Microsoft Windows&#174; typically find a lot of unfamiliar concepts, and get frustrated trying to do things the way they are accustomed to doing them.  This section will give you a conceptual overview of some basic aspects of MEPIS Linux, and how they differ from other systems to help ease your transition.</p>

<p>MEPIS Linux ultimately inherits its fundamental design from Unix, an operating system that has been around in various forms since 1970 &mdash;much earlier than MS-Windows&reg;.   &nbsp;MEPIS Linux is also mainly composed of <strong>free, open-source software (FOSS)</strong> (i.e. software that is distributed without restrictions on the use of its source code).  The Unix heritage plus the open-source nature of MEPIS have a strong impact on its design.</p>

<p>Unix provided the foundation for the development of Linux starting in 1991.  As is well known, Linus Torvalds united his developing kernel with the free software framework of the GNU Project, started by Richard Stallman in 1984, and the resulting OS is often referred to as GNU-Linux.</p>  

<p>A user interface of some sort  needs to serve for input and control.  At its simplest, this interface is a command line, as in the original Unix and also in the original MS-DOS prior to MS-Windows, but today all the most popular Linux versions use a graphical user interface (GUI) that relies on the X Window System, a software system and protocol that provides the basic framework for graphical display.</p> 

<p>Finally, MEPIS builds directly on the highly popular Linux <a href="index.html#s12-1_distro" class="spterm" title="Software project that manages a remote collection of Linux-based software" >distribution</a> called Debian, its direct upstream source of fundamental structures and features.  Founded in 1993, Debian has become preeminent in areas such as package development, release protocol, organizational structure and commitment to free software.  To the solid core provided by Debian's stable release (which the Debian development version &ldquo;Lenny&rdquo; is about to become), MEPIS adds user-friendly  features such as a very simple installation tool, excellent hardware recognition, a set of configuration &ldquo;Assistants,&rdquo; and a LiveCD framework &mdash;all supported by a lively and knowledgeable Community that contributes to MEPIS the artwork and documentation, as well as additional software packages.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.1  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-1">10.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The filesystem structure</h1>
<h2>Orientation</h2>

<p>There are two basic uses of the term &ldquo;filesystem.&rdquo; The first is the Operating System's Filesystem. This refers to the files and their organization that the operating system uses to keep track of all the hardware and software resources it has as its disposal while running. The other use of the term filesystem refers to the Disk Filesystem, designed for the storage and retrieval of files on a data storage device, most commonly a disk drive. The Disk Filesystem is set when the disk partition is first formatted, prior to writing any data on the partition.  </p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-1_os">The Operating System's Filesystem</h2>
<p>One of the first problems many new Linux users struggle with is how the filesystem works. If you have been looking around your MEPIS Linux system trying to find the <strong>C:\</strong> drive or <strong>D:\</strong> drive, for instance, you are searching in vain: MEPIS handles hard drives and other storage media differently from Windows. Rather than having a separate filesystem tree on every device, MEPIS has a single filesystem tree ( called the <em>root</em> of the filesystem) which is marked &ldquo;<strong>/</strong>&rdquo; and contains <em>every</em> attached device.  When a storage device is added to the system, its filesystem is attached to a directory or subdirectory of the file system; this is called <strong>mounting</strong> a drive or device. </p>


<p> If you open Dolphin and browse to &ldquo;<strong>/</strong>&rdquo;, you will notice a number of directories with names based on the <strong>Unix Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</strong>. Here is a simple description of the major directories in MEPIS along with a common example of when users commonly work with files there (see MEPIS Wiki for details):</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>/bin</strong>  This directory contains binary program files which are used by the system during startup, but which also may be required by user actions once the system is fully up and running.
<p><em>Example</em>: Many basic command-line programs, such as the Bash shell, and utilities like <em>dd</em>, <em>grep</em>, <em>ls</em>, and <em>mount</em> are located here, in addition to programs only used by the OS. </p>
<hr /></li>



<li><strong>/boot</strong>  As you might guess, files that Linux needs to boot are located here. The Linux kernel, the core of the Linux operating system, is kept here, as are bootloaders such as GRUB.  
<p><em>Example</em>: users modify <strong>/boot/grub/menu.lst</strong> to change the list of bootable  operating systems or the length of time to wait for default booting.</p>
<hr /></li>



<li><strong>/dev</strong>  In this directory are special files that link to the various input/output devices on the system.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed directly by users, except in CLI mounting commands.</p>
<hr /></li>



<li><strong>/etc </strong> This directory contains configuration files for the system such as  as well as application configuration files.
<p><em>Example</em>: The file <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> specifies mount points for additional filesystems on devices, partitions, etc. that can be configured for your optimal use.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: display problems sometimes involve editing the file <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong>.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/home</strong> Here the user's personal directories (data and settings) reside. If there is more than one user, a separate subdirectory is set up for each. No user (except root) can read another user's home directory.  The user's directory contains both hidden (where the filename is preceded by a dot) and visible files; hidden files can be revealed by clicking <strong>View >Show Hidden Files</strong> in Dolphin.
<p><em>Example:</em> users typically organize their own files at first by using default directories such as Documents, Music, etc.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> your Firefox profile is located in <strong>.mozilla/firefox</strong></p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/lib</strong>  This directory contains shared object libraries (analogous to Windows DLL's) that are required at boot time. In
particular, kernel modules will be found here, under <strong>/lib/modules</strong>.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/media </strong> Files for removable media such as CDroms, floppy drives, and USB memory sticks are installed here when the media are automounted.
<p><em>Example</em>: After dynamically mounting a peripheral device like a flash drive, you may access it here.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/mnt</strong> Physical storage devices must be mounted here before they can be accessed. After drives or partitions are defined in the <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> file, then their filesystem is mounted here.
<p><em>Example</em>: Users can access drives and partitions mounted here.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/opt</strong> This is the intended location of major third-party application subsystems installed by the user. 
<p><em>Example</em>: if you want to install Google Earth, this is where you place it. Some distros, including MEPIS, also place user-installed programs in /usr subdirectories.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/root</strong> This is the <em>home directory</em> for the root (adminstrator) user. Note that this is not the same as &ldquo;<strong>/</strong>&rdquo; the filesystem root.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users, but files saved while logged in as the root user may be saved here.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/sbin</strong>  Programs are installed here if they are required by the system startup scripts but will not normally be run by
users, other than root  &mdash;in other words, system administration utilities. 
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users, but this is where files like modprobe and ifconfig are located.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/tmp</strong> This is the location of temporary files produced by programs  &mdash;such as compilers&mdash;  as they run. In general, these are short-term temporary files, of use to a program only while it is running.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/usr</strong> This directory contains many things for user applications, and is analogous in some ways to the Windows directory &ldquo;Program Files&rdquo;. 
<p><em>Example</em>: many executables are located in (<strong>/usr/bin</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: documentation (<strong>/usr/docs</strong>) and configuration files, graphics and icons are in (<strong>/usr/share</strong>).</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/var</strong> This directory contains files that are constantly changing while Linux is running, e.g. logs, system mail and queued processes.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users.</p>
<hr /></li>

</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-1_disk_fs">The Disk Filesystem</h2>
<p>The disk filesystem is something about which the average user does not need to be much concerned. The default disk filesystem used by MEPIS Linux is called <strong>ext3</strong>, a version of the ext2 filesystem that is journaled &mdash;i.e., it writes changes to a log before enacting them, rendering it more robust. The filesystem ext3 is set during installation when your your hard drive is formatted.</p> 
<p>By and large, ext3 has more years, in its track record over any of its rivals, of combining stability and speed, and we do not recommend installing MEPIS onto a different disk filesystem unless you are well-educated in the differences.  However, MEPIS can read and write to many other formatted disk filesystems, and may even be installed on some of them, if for some reason one of them is preferred over ext3. This includes for the first time ext4, a journaling file system being developed as the successor to ext3.</p>

<p>NOTE: if you are dual or multi-booting different operating systems on the same computer, see <a href="index.html#section09-6">Section 9.6: Accessing other partitions</a> for more information.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.2  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-2">10.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permissions</h1>


<p>MEPIS is an account-based operating system. This means that no program can run without a user account to run under, and any running program is thereby limited by the permissions granted to the user who started it. </p>

<p>In MEPIS Linux there is one and only one user account which has permission to do everything; this account is called <strong>root</strong> (not to be confused with the &ldquo;root&rdquo; of the filesystem, mentioned in Section 10.1 see: <a class="spterm" href="#s12-1_rootfs" title="see Glossary for more info.">root filesystem</a>). The <a class="spterm" href="#s12-1_rootuser" title="see Glossary for more info.">root user</a> has a unique password that is set during system installation. When you run programs (such as Synaptic or MEPIS System Assistants) that need to access or change protected operating system files and directories, you will be prompted for the root password.  Once you enter it, MEPIS will be able to make the specific changes it needs.</p>
<p></p>

<p>NOTE: Much of the security and stability that Linux is known for hinges on the proper use of limited user accounts, and the protection provided by default file and directory permissions. For this reason, you should operate as <em>root</em> only for a procedure that requires it. Never log into MEPIS as root to run the computer for normal activities! </p>

<br />
<h2 id="s10-2_basic">Basic information</h2>
<p>The default file permissions structure in Linux is fairly simple, but more than adequate for most situations.  For each file or folder, there are three permissions that can be granted, and three entities (owner/creator, group, others/world) to which they are granted.  The permissions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Read</strong> permission means that data can be read from the file; it also means the file can be copied. If you don't have read permission for a directory you can't even see the names of files listed in it.
</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong> permission means that the file or folder can be changed, appended, or deleted.  For directories, it specifies whether a user can write to files in the directory.
</li>
<li><strong>Execute</strong> permission means whether or not the user can run the file as a script or program.  For directories, it determines whether or not the user can enter and make it the current working directory. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Every file and folder acquires a single user designated as its owner when it is created on the system.  (Note that if you move a file from another partition where it has a different owner, it will keep the original owner; but if you copy and paste it, it will be assigned to you.)  It also has a single group designated as its group, by default the group to which the owner belongs.  The permissions you grant to others affect everyone who isn't the owner or in the owning group.</p>

<p>NOTE: For advanced users, there are additional special attributes beyond read/write/execute that can be set: sticky bit, SUID, and SGID.  For more information, see <a href="index.html#s10-2_links">Links and Guides for Section 10.2.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-2_view-set">Viewing, setting and changing permissions</h2>
<h3>Dolphin</h3>
<p>To view or change a file's permissions in KDE, right-click the file and select <strong>Properties</strong>.  Click the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab.  Here you can set the permissions granted to the owner, group, and others using the pull-down menus.  For some files (like <a href="index.html#section09-7">scripts</a>, for instance), you need to check the box to make them executable, and for folders you can check a box to limit the deletion of files inside it to the owners. If necessary, you can click <strong>Advanced Permissions</strong> and see the permissions grid for the file.</p>
<p>NOTE: you must be operating as root to change the permission of a file or directory whose owner is root.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="s10-2_kuser">KUser</h3>
<p>KUser is part of KDE and can be reached by clicking <strong>Start Menu > System > KUser (User Manager)</strong> and supplying the root password.  The main screen has two tabs, one for users and the other for groups; above them sits a toolbar and on top a menu bar.  Here are the icons on the toolbar:</p>

<img src="grafx/KUser_icons.jpg" alt="KUser icons" width="226" height="31" />
<p>The first three buttons in the toolbar have to do with user management (default tab): add user, edit user, and delete any user highlighted. The second three are used with similar functions for group management (Groups tab), and allow you to decide who belongs to each group. The screens that pop up are pretty self-explanatory, but you can consult the KUser Handbook found under Help.</p>

<h3 id="s10-2_muser">MUser</h3>
<p>The <a href="index.html#section05-3-3">MEPIS User Assistant</a> can also be used to add or delete a user.  In addition, it can restore default values for groups and memberships.</p>

<br />
<h3 id="s10-2_cli">CLI commands</h3>

<p>Although Dolphin and KUser cover most daily situations, sometimes it can be preferable to deal with the command line.  Basic permissions are represented by <strong>r</strong> (read), <strong>w</strong> (write) and <strong>x</strong> (execute).</p> 

<p>To view permissions of a file on the command line, type this: </p> 
<pre>ls -l NameOfFile</pre>
<p>The -l switch will cause the file to be list in long format, displaying its permissions among other information.  Here is an example of what the user "newbie" might see for the Firefox profiles.ini file:</p> 
<pre>newbie@Computer:$ ls -l /home/newbie/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini
-<strong>rw-r--r--</strong> 1 newbie users 94 2008-10-22 10:07 profiles.ini
</pre>
<p>The bolded "rw-r--r--" bit right after the opening dash (indicating it is a regular file) contains read/write/execute permissions for owner, group and others: 9 characters total.  Here it shows us that the owner has read and write but not execute (<strong>rw-</strong>), but the group and others can only read (<strong>r--</strong>).  The owner in this case is specified to be "newbie" who belongs to the group "users".</p>

<p>If for some reason it was necessary to change the ownership of this file to root using the command line, you would use the <strong>chown</strong> command like this:</p>
<pre>chown root /home/newbie/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini</pre>
<p>For details on using chown, as well as the more detailed <strong>chmod</strong>, see <a href="index.html#s10-2_links">Links and Guides for Section 10.2.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Sometimes a program needs to have a user registered before it will operate correctly. Let's take an example with the photo organizer DigiKam, which can be fussy about this. According to the directions on the DigiKam home page, the username should be added to the user group &ldquo;camera&rdquo; but that group is not listed. Here's how you would do that: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start Menu > System > KUser (User Manager)</strong>, and supply root's password.
</li>
<li>Click on the Groups tab, and confirm that there is no group name &ldquo;camera.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>add group</strong> icon, or on the menu bar Group >Add... 
</li>
<li>In the dialogue box that pops up, type <strong>camera</strong> as Group name.
</li>
<li>Highlight your username in the column on the right, then click the middle <strong>Add...</strong> button to move your username into the column Users in Group. 
</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK.</strong>
</li>
<li>The Group tab now includes the group &ldquo;camera&rdquo; with your username. 
</li>
</ol>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.3  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-3">10.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Configuration files</h1>


<p>With only rare exceptions, program and system settings on MEPIS Linux are stored in discrete plaintext configuration files; there is no &ldquo;Registry&rdquo; which requires special tools to edit.  Most configuration files are just simple lists of parameters and values which are read by programs when they launch to determine their behavior.</p>

<h2>User config files</h2>
<p>Files that hold individual user settings (such as high scores for your games, or the layout of your desktop) are stored within a user's home directory, typically as a hidden file or directory, and can only be edited by that user or by root.</p>  
<p>These personal configuration files are actually less often edited directly than system files because most of the user configuration is done graphically through the applications themselves.  When you open an application and click <strong>Edit >Preferences</strong>, for example, your selections are written to a (usually hidden) configuration file in your user directory.  Likewise in Firefox, when you type <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar, you are editing the hidden configuration files.</p>
<br /><br />


<h2 id="s10-3_system">System config files</h2>
<p>Files that hold system-wide configurations or defaults (such as the file that determines which services automatically launch during boot up) are largely stored in the <strong>/etc/</strong> directory and are only editable by root.  Most of these files are never touched directly by regular users, such as these for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/etc/rc.d/rc5.d</strong> &mdash; Contains files to control runlevel 5 into which MEPIS boots after login.
</li>
<li><strong>/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</strong> &mdash; Used to configure the keyboard.
</li>
<li><strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong> &mdash; Defines internet interfaces on the system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some configuration files can contain just a few lines, or even be empty, while others may be quite long.  The important point is that if you are looking for a configuration file for an application or process, head for the <strong>/etc</strong> directory and look around.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-3_example">Example</h2>
<p>We already looked at editing the configuration file <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> to mount other partitions (<a href="index.html#section09-6">Section 9.6</a>), but let's look at another example here.</p>

<p>Display problems can be solved with a number of grahical and command-line tools, as we saw in <a href="index.html#section05-2-2">Section 5.2.2</a>, but once in a while a user needs to directly edit the system-wide configuration file <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong>.  (NOTE: like all configuration files, this should always be backed up before editing.)  This file is long and has lots of entries, but let's say you are still having problems with your USB mouse after using the standard tools, and want to check how it is actually configured.  You open the file, then search and find the correct entry, something like this:</p>

<pre>Section "InputDevice"
  Identifier "USB Mouse"
  Driver "mouse"
  Option "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
  Option "Protocol" "auto"
  Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
  Option "Buttons" "5"
EndSection</pre>
<p>To try to improve mouse functionality, you might decide to substitute the exact information about the mouse's manufacturer and model in place of the word &ldquo;auto.&rdquo;  Similar steps are sometimes taken with a monitor or keyboard, for instance, when no other tool has worked.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.4  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-4">10.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Runlevels</h1>
<p>MEPIS Linux boots up by executing the program <strong>init</strong>. After completing the boot process, <strong>init</strong>
executes all start scripts in a directory specified by the default runlevel (this runlevel is given by the entry for id in
<strong>/etc/inittab</strong>). Like most other Linux versions, MEPIS has 7 runlevels:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Halt (power down)</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Single-user mode: provides a root console without logon.  Useful if you lose your root password</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Multiuser with no network</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Console logon, no X (i.e. no GUI)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Not used/custom</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Default GUI logon</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Reboot </td></tr>
</table>

<p>MEPIS defaults to runlevel 5, therefore any <strong>init</strong> scripts set up in the level 5 config file will run at boot.</p> 
<br /><br />
 
<h2 id="s10-4_use">Use</h2>
<p>Understanding runlevels can be handy.  When users have a problem with X Window Manager, for instance, they can not work on it on the default runlevel 5, because as we just saw that is the level where X runs.  But they can drop to runlevel 3 where they can work to fix things by opening a terminal, becoming root, and typing:</p>
<pre>
telinit 3
</pre>
<p class="fl">Once you are out of X and looking at a prompt, login with your normal username and password.  To get back to the login screen, become root and
type:</p>

<pre>
telinit 5
</pre>

<p>Other useful commands when you are looking at the prompt on runlevel 3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>halt</strong> (as root) &mdash;  shuts the machine down.</li>
<li><strong>reboot</strong> (as root) &mdash; reboots the machine.</li>
<li><strong>[application command]</strong>  &mdash; will run that application.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fl">It is equally possible to <em>boot</em> to runlevel 3 by merely adding the number three at the end of the boot options on the GRUB screen.  From there you can simply type: </p>
<pre>startx</pre> 
<p class="fl">to get to runlevel 5 and your desktop.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.5  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-5">10.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Kernel </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Last place in this User's Manual goes to the first and most important element of MEPIS Linux: the Linux kernel.  Every Linux version (distro) uses some version of the kernel, which was first developed and is still maintained by Linus Torvalds, with input from many other programmers around the world.</p>
<p>The following diagrams and descriptions of the GNU/Linux kernel come from the <em>Anatomy of the Linux kernel</em> and gives the average user a clear sense of the kernel's place in the Linux  OS:</p>
<img src="grafx/Kernel.jpg" alt="Kernel" width="370" height="250" />
<p><em>At the top is the user, or application, space. This is where the user applications are executed. Below the user space is the kernel space. Here, the Linux kernel exists.</em></p>

<p><em>There is also the GNU C Library (glibc). This provides the system call interface that connects to the kernel and provides the mechanism to transition between the user-space application and the kernel. This is important because the kernel and user application occupy different protected address spaces. And while each user-space process occupies its own virtual address space, the kernel occupies a single address space. </em></p>
<p>The kernel itself has a number of components that include process management, memory management, network stack (definition of a particular group of protocols along with the software to implement them), virtual file system, and device drivers. The largest of these by far is the collection of device drivers that are necessary to make your hardware usable.</p>

<p>Much more detail is available from the documents referenced in the <a href="index.html#s10-5_links ">Links and Guides for Section 10.5.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-5_versions">Kernel versions</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel is in constant development, so it uses a version numbering system to keep track.  MEPIS Linux 8.5 is released using the kernel <strong>2.6.32</strong>, but that will change over time.  To find out your current major kernel version name, open a terminal and type:</p>
<pre>$ uname -r</pre>
<p>You will see a result something like <strong>2.6.32-1-mepis-smp</strong> (32bit) or <strong>2.6.32-1-mepis64-smp</strong> (64bit).  The MEPIS kernel also has an internal version number that you can see by looking on the "Installed files" tab of the current kernel entry in Synaptic.</p>
<p>Unlike other software on your system, the kernel is not upgraded automatically except below the minor revision level (indicated by the third number in the kernel name).  To upgrade the kernel when a new one becomes available in the repos, follow this procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic as root and search on the word &ldquo;linux-image&rdquo;.
</li>
<li>Look at the results carefully, and install the image marked upgradeable that has the word "mepis" attached and the next higher version number.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Such updates (only internal version number changes) can be installed without endangering the reboot process.  Kernel upgrades, where the major number changes will show up as a new package instead of an upgrade in Synaptic, should be approached with caution. They can be problematic, and may require manual editing of GRUB (see Wiki).</p>
<p>To solve particular problems, advanced users sometimes make use of <strong>kernel patches</strong>.  A patch is program that updates files according to instructions contained in a separate file, called a patch file. The patch file consists of a list of differences that can be run to change the original file. For details, follow the Wiki link below.</p>
<p>Advanced users sometimes compile and install their own kernel, starting with the kernel source code.  The motivation for doing this can range from pure fun to practical goals such as to produce a kernel optimized for a certain architecture and use.  Although the procedure is complicated, detailed directions can be found in the MEPIS Wiki if needed.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-5_headers">Kernel headers</h2>
<p>In order to compile some programs you might need to have kernel headers, which are C files that define structures and constants that are needed for building most standard programs. Some programs ask for kernel sources, but most often the headers are sufficient.  You can find them in Synaptic, but you have to be careful to match the headers to your kernel version.  For this reason, it is actually somewhat easier to open a terminal, become root, and type:</p>
<pre> apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)</pre>
<p>This code will enter automatically the number of your working kernel and fetch the appropriate headers.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-5_panic">Kernel panic and recovery</h2>

<p>A kernel panic is a relatively rare action taken by the MEPIS Linux system when it detects an internal fatal error from which it cannot safely recover.  It can be caused by a number of different factors that range from hardware problems to a bug in the system itself.  When you get a kernel panic, try rebooting with the MEPIS Linux LiveCD, which will overcome temporarily any software problems and hopefully allow you to see and offload your data.  If that doesn't work, then unplug all unnecessary hardware and try again.</p>

<p>Your first concern is to access and secure your data.  Hopefully, you have it backed up somewhere.  If not, you can use one of the data recovery programs such as <strong>testdisk</strong> or <strong>ddrescue</strong> that are supplied with MEPIS Linux (details in the Wiki).  Your last resort is to take your harddrive to a professional recovery business.</p>
<p>There are a number of steps you might have to take to recover a functional MEPIS Linux system once you have your data safe, although ultimately you may have to reinstall using the LiveCD.  Depending on the type of failure, the following steps may be undertaken:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove packages that broke the system.</li>
<li>Reinstall the X config file.</li>
<li>Reinstall GRUB.</li>
<li>Reset the root password.</li>
<li>Reinstall MEPIS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to ask on the forum.mepiscommunity.org if you have any questions about these procedures.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something that is not covered in this Manual, these MEPIS resources are available for more help.</p>


<h2>MEPIS Community website</h2>
<p>Built and maintained by members of the MEPIS community, this website has links to nearly all aspects of MEPIS Linux online. Designed to be the primary bookmark for the MEPIS Linux user, it contains not only links to other MEPIS-related websites, but up-to-date news on MEPIS Community Projects &mdash;such as the Community Software Repository and the MEPIS Torrent Team&mdash; that are available nowhere else.  Available in six languages. </p>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s11-1_wiki">Wiki</h2>
<p>The MEPIS Wiki contains a great deal of other material.  As an ongoing product of volunteer users, it can be more up-to-date and detailed than the Manual.  Here's how to find what you're looking for:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Follow the structure by drilling down in the four areas laid out on the Main Page:
<ul> <!--sublist 1 -->
<li><u>Getting Started</u>: intended to provide new MEPIS users with the basic tools to get their system up and running.</li>
<li><u>General Knowledge Database</u>: intended to provide users with more advanced tools to understand and use their MEPIS system.</li>
<li><u>Help and Guides</u>: self-explanatory title, there is great stuff here for MEPIS users.</li>
<li><u>Wiki Issues</u>: topics pertaining to the Wiki itself.</li>
</ul></li>  <!--end sublist 1 -->

<li>Consult Special Pages: 
 <ul> <!-- sublist 2 -->
 <li>Click on the <strong>Wiki Categories</strong> link in the left panel, and select your topic of interest.  This is a very useful but often overlooked way to find answers to your questions.
</li>
<li>If you are looking for something added recently, click on the <strong>Recent Changes</strong> link.
</li>
<li>Click on the link <strong>Special pages</strong> for other possible aids.
</li>
</ul></li> <!--end sublist 2 -->
</ol>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s11-1_forums">Forums</h2>
<p>MEPIS Linux users have a number of forums at their disposal:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>forum.mepiscommunity.org:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A friendly community forum for every level of knowledge, from newbie to expert.
</li>
<li><strong>MEPIS forums in other languages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> MEPISIMO  Spanish forum, MEPIS France, and MEPISItalia
</li>
<li><strong>LinuxQuestions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A venerable Linux forum that has a section dedicated to MEPIS.
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Links and Guides section at the bottom of the page for all the above.</p>
<h3>Forum protocol</h3>
<p>To get the answer you are seeking on any of these forums, please try to follow these procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Do some research</u> on your own, reading the Wiki and using the search engines.
</li>
<li><u>Use meaningful, specific subject headers</u> so people know what you are talking about.  &ldquo;PLEASE HELP ME&rdquo; is not going to
get you much attention, whereas &ldquo;MEPIS problems with HP scanner&rdquo; is much more likely to attract people who can help.
</li>
<li><u>Describe carefully</u> your hardware (see Section 5.1) and the sequence of actions that led to the problem(s).
</li>
<li><u>Remain courteous</u>: these forums are staffed by volunteers who give of their time, knowledge, and expertise for the sole reason of
wanting to help--the simple words "thank you" can do wonders.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s11-1_search">Search engines</h2>
<p>A number of search engines can be used for more help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wiki</strong> search engines:
 
<ul> <!--sublist 1 -->
<li><u>Basic search</u>: type what you are looking for into the search box in the left panel and hit return.
</li>
<li><u>Detailed search</u>: click on the Custom search lin in the left panel.  This will take you to page powered by a custom Google search
that will search the entire Wiki for whatever you enter.
</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 1 -->

<li><strong>Mepis.org</strong> search engine -- good tool that gives you access to all the older discussions and announcements published on the main MEPIS site.  Be careful that the information you find applies to your version of MEPIS.
</li>
<li><strong>forum.mepiscommunity.org</strong> search engine -- another good tool on this community site.
</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> or another universal search engine -- you need to be careful about suitability of results, but these can be
particularly useful for tracking down drivers, error messages, hardware specs, etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: much of the Linux documentation on the web is out-of-date or unsuitable for MEPIS Linux, and could actually do more
harm than good to your system! Ask on the MEPIS community forum, if you are not certain whether or not an internet tip is applicable to
MEPIS.</p>

<h1 id="section12-1">12:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glossary of common terms </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Linux terms can be confusing and offputting at first, so this Glossary provides a list of the ones used in this Manual to get you started. For more help on the terms used in the Linux computer world, see Links and Guides.</p>

<p>If you reached this page by clicking on a <span class="spterm" title="This is green, and if ye didn't ken green, 'twould define it for ye.">green</span> glossary link, use your browser's <strong> [&#060;&mdash;]&nbsp;&nbsp; back button</strong>  to return you to your previous page. </p>

<br /><br />

<h2>Terms</h2>
<p id="s12-1_backend"><strong>backend:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>back-end.</em>  The backend includes the various components of a program that process the user input entered through the frontend.  See also frontend.</p>

<p id="s12-1_backport"><strong>backport:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  Backports are new packages that have been recompiled to run on a released distribution in order to keep it up-to-date.</p>

<p id="s12-1_bash"><strong>BASH:</strong> The default shell on most Linux systems as well as on Mac OS X, BASH is an acronym for <em>Bourne-again shell.</em> For more information, see Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p id="s12-1_bittorrent"><strong>BitTorrent:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also<em> bit torrent</em> or <em>torrent.</em>  A method invented by Bram Cohen to distribute large files without the need for a single individual to provide the hardware, hosting and bandwidth resources required. </p>

<p id="s12-1_bootloader"><strong>Bootloader:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Program that initially chooses an operating system to load after the BIOS has finished intializing the hardware. Extremely small in size. the bootloader's only job is to hand contol of the computer over to the Operating System's kernel. Advanced bootloaders offer a menu to choose between several installed operating systems.  </p>

<p id="s12-1_bootoptions"><strong>Boot options:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  Also <em>cheat codes</em>.  Additional boot and kernel commands available to modify the boot and installation procedures. An example is &ldquo;vga=normal&rdquo; which tells the system to disable the default resolution, often used for older monitors.</p>

<p id="s12-1_chainloading">
<strong>chainloading:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>chain loading.</em> Instead of directly loading an operating system, a boot manager like GRUB can use chain loading to pass control from itself to a boot sector on a hard disk partition. The target boot sector is loaded in from disk (replacing the boot sector from which the boot manager itself was loaded) and the new boot  program is executed.  In addition to when it is necessary, as in booting Windows from GRUB, the advantage to chainloading is that each operating system on the hard disk drive &mdash;and there could be dozens&mdash; can be responsible for having the correct data in it's own boot sector. So GRUB residing in the MBR need not be rewritten every time there are any changes.  GRUB can simply chainload the relevant information from the boot sector of a given partition whether it has changed or remained the same since the last boot time.

<p id="s12-1_cloop"><strong>cloop error:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  A failure to read a block of compressed data. <em>CLOOP</em>
is shorthand for <em>compressed loopback device</em>, a linux kernel module that allows a compressed filesystem to be read, such as is used on a MEPIS LiveCD.</p>

<p id="s12-1_cli"><strong>command line interface (CLI):&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also known as <em>console, Konsole, terminal, command prompt, shell,</em> or <em>bash.</em> This is a UNIX-style text interface, which MS-DOS was also designed to resemble. A <em>root console</em> is one where administrative privileges have been acquired after entering the root password.</p>

<p id="s12-1_desktop-env"><strong>desktop environment:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The software which provides a graphical desktop (windows, icons, desktop, task bar, etc) for an operating system user. MEPIS integrates the KDE desktop and configures it to feel familiar to both Windows&#174; and Mac OS&nbsp;X&#174; users.</p>

<p id="s12-1_diskimage"><strong>disk image:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A file containing the complete contents and structure of a data storage medium or device such as a hard drive or DVD.  See also ISO.</p>

<p id="s12-1_distro"> <strong>Distribution:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Linux Distribution, or &ldquo;distro&rdquo;, is a particular packaging of the Linux kernel with various GNU software packages, and  different desktops or window managers.  Since &mdash;unlike the proprietary code used in the Microsoft and Apple OS's&mdash; GNU/Linux is Free, Open-Source Software, literally anyone in the world who has the ability can freely build on what has been done and innovate a new vision of a GNU/Linux operating system. MEPIS Linux is a distro based on the Debian Linux family. </p>


<p id="s12-1_filesystem"><strong>file system:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also <em>filesystem.</em> This refers to the way that files and folders are logically arranged on a computer's storage devices so they may be found by the operating system. It can also refer to the type of formatting on a storage device, such as the common Windows formats NTFS and FAT32, or the Linux formats ext3, ext4 or ReiserFS, and in this sense refers to the method actually used to encode binary data on the Hard Disk Drive, floppy, flash drive, etc.</p>

<p id="s12-1_free"><strong>free-as-in-speech:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> The English word &ldquo;free&rdquo; has two possible meanings: 1) without cost, and 2) without restrictions. In part of the open-source software community, an analogy used to explain the difference is 1) &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in beer vs. 2) &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in speech. The word <em>freeware</em> is used universally to refer to software that is simply without cost, whereas the phrase <em>free software</em> loosely refers to software that is more properly called open-source software, licensed under some type of open source license such as <a href="#s12-1_gpl" class="spterm" >the GPL.</a></p>

<p id="s12-1_frontend"><strong>frontend:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also <em>front-end</em>. The front-end is the part of a software system that interacts directly with the user. See also backend. </p>

<p id="s12-1_gpl"><strong>GPL:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The GNU General Public License. This is a license under which many open-source
applications are released. It specifies that you may view, modify, and redistribute the source code of applications released under it, within certain limits; but that you may not distribute the executable code unless you also distribute the source code to anyone who asks for it.</p>

<p id="s12-1_gui"><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> This refers to a program or operating system interface that uses pictures (icons, windows, etc), as opposed to text (command-line) interfaces.</p>

<p id="s12-1_home-dir"><strong>home directory:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>   One of the 17 top-level directories branching from the root directory in MEPIS Linux, <strong>/home</strong> contains a subdirectory for every registered user of the system. Within each user's home directory s/he has full read-write privileges.  Further, most of the user-specific configuration files for various installed programs are stored in hidden subdirectories within the /home/<em>username</em> directory &mdash;as is downloaded email. Other downloaded files usually go by default into the home/<em>username</em>/Documents or /home/<em>username</em>/Desktop subdirectories. </p>

<p  id="s12-1_iso"><strong>ISO:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A disc image following an international standard that contains data files and filesystem metadata, including boot code, structures, and attributes.  This is the normal method for delivering Linux versions such as MEPIS over the Internet. See also <em>disk image.</em></p>

<p id="s12-1_kernel"><strong>kernel:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The layer of software in an operating system that interacts directly with the hardware.</p>

<p id="s12-1_kicker"><strong>Kicker:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  The panel in KDE that appears by default at the bottom of the screen and contains navigation icons, open (minimized) programs and system notifications. It is highly configurable, and can include a utility to switch between any of several desktops you can run simultaneously, if your primary desktop surface tends to get cluttered with open programs. For a graphic and a short explanation of its default appearance, see <a href="index.html#s03-3_kicker"> Section 3.3: Kicker.</a></p>

<p id="s12-1_livecd"><strong>LiveCD:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A bootable compact disc from which one can run an operating system, usually with a complete desktop environment, applications, and essential hardware functionality. In 2003, MEPIS was the first distribution of Linux to include a GUI-based Installer application on the desktop of a fully functional LiveCD, so a separate Installation CD was no longer needed. Simultaneously, MEPIS was also the first Linux to include GUI-based tools, now called <em>Assistants,</em> on the LiveCD to help a user repair a broken system.</p>

<p id="s12-1_mbr"><strong>MBR:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> Master Boot Record: the first 512-byte sector of a bootable hard disk drive. Special data written to the MBR enables the computer's BIOS to pass the boot process off to a partition with an installed operating system.</p>

<p id="s12-1_md5sum"><strong>md5sum:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A program that calculates and verifies a file's data integrity. The MD5 hash (or checksum) functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file. It is extremely unlikely that any two non-identical files will have the same MD5 hash. Because almost any change to a file will cause its MD5 hash to also change, the MD5 hash is commonly used to verify the integrity of files.</p>

<p id="s12-1_mirror"><strong>mirror:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> Also <em>mirror site.</em>  An exact copy of another Internet site, commonly used to provide multiple sources of the same information to supply  reliable access to large downloads. </p>

<p id="s12-1_module"><strong>module:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>   Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.</p>

<p id="s12-1_mountpoint"><strong>mountpoint:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The place on the root filesystem where a fixed or removable device is attached (mounted) and accessible as a subdirectory. All computer hardware needs to have a mountpoint in the filesystem to be usable. Most standard devices such as keyboard, monitor and your primary hard disk drive are mounted automatically at boot.</p>

<p id="s12-1_ntfs"><strong>NTFS&#174;:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>  Microsoft's New Technology File System  debuted in 1993 on the Windows NT Operating System, geared to business networks, and with revisions entered the mainstream Windows users' desktop computers in later versions of Windows 2000. It has been the standard file system since Windows XP was introduced in late 2001. Unix/Linux-oriented folk say it stands for "Nice Try File System."</p>

<p id="s12-1_opensource"><strong>open-source:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Software whose source code has been made available to the public under a license that allows individuals to modify and redistribute the source code. In some cases, open-source licenses restrict the distribution of binary executable code. For more information visit the Open Software Initiative (link below).</p>

<p id="s12-1_package"><strong>package:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A package is a discrete, non-executable bundle of data that includes instructions for your package manager about installation. A package  doesn't always contain a single application; it might contain only part of a large application, several small utilities, font data, graphics, or help files. </p>

<p id="s12-1_package-man"><strong>package manager:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A package manager such as (Synaptic or Gdebi) is a collection of tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages. See <a href="index.html#section07-2 ">7.2: Synaptic Software Package Manager</a></p>

<p id="s12-1_port"><strong>port:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>  A virtual data connection that can be used by programs to exchange data directly, instead of going through a file or other temporary storage location.  Ports have numbers assigned for specific protocols and applications, such as 80 for HTTP, 5190 for AIM, etc.</p>

<p id="s12-1_repo"><strong>repo:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> See <em>repository</em>. </p>

<p id="s12-1_repository"><strong>repository:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A software repository is an internet storage location from which software packages may be retrieved and installed via a <a href="index.html#s12-1_package-man" class="spterm" >package manager.</a>  In MEPIS Linux, the repository list file (<strong>/etc/apt.sources.list</strong>) is typically modified through the default package manager <em>Synaptic.</em> </p>

<p id="s12-1_rootfs"><strong>root&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Root has two common meanings in Unix/Linux OSs, and they are intimately connected, but the distinction is important to understand. The <strong>root <a href="#s12-1_filesystem"  class="spterm" >filesystem</a></strong> is the basic logical structure of all the files the operating system can access, whether programs, processes, pipes or data. It should follow the Unix Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, which specifies where in the hierarchy to locate all types of files. </p>
<p id="s12-1_rootuser">The second meaning of <strong>root</strong> is the computer <strong>user</strong> who owns the root filesystem &mdash;and so has all permissions necessary to do anything to any file. While it is sometimes necessary to temporarily assume the powers of the <strong><em>root user</em></strong> to install or configure programs, it is dangerous and violates the basic security structure of Unix/Linux to log in and operate as <em>root</em> unless absolutlely necessary. In a command line interface, a regular user can temporarily become root by issuing the command <strong>su</strong> then entering the root password.</p>

<p id="s12-1_runlevel"><strong>runlevel&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A runlevel is a preset operating state on a Unix-like operating system.  A system can be booted into any of several runlevels, each of which is represented by a single digit integer. Each runlevel designates a different system configuration and allows access to a different combination of processes (i.e., instances of executing programs). See <a href="index.html#section10-4 ">Section 10.4: Runlevels</a> </p>

<p id="s12-1_script"><strong>script:&nbsp;</strong> An executable text file, containing commands in an interpreted language. Usually refers to BASH scripts which are used extensively &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; of the Linux operating system, but other languages may be used as well.</p>

<p id="s12-1_sourcecode"><strong>source code:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The human-readable code in which software is written prior to being assembled or compiled into machine-language code.</p>

<p id="s12-1_switch"><strong>switch:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  A switch (also <em>flag</em>, <em>option</em> or <em>parameter</em>) is a modifier appended to a command to change its behavior.  A common example is <strong>-R</strong> (recursive), which tells the computer to carry out the command through all subdirectories.</p>

<p id="s12-1_symlink"><strong>symlink:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also symbolic link and soft link. A special type of file that points to another file or directory and not to data.  It allows the same file to have different names and/or locations.</p>

<p id="s12-1_tarball"><strong>tarball:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> An archiving format, like zip, popular on the Linux platform. Unlike zip files, though, tarballs may use one of a number of different compression formats, such as gzip or bzip2. They usually end in file extensions like .tgz, .tar.gz, or .tar.bz2. Many archive formats are supported in MEPIS with a graphical application called Ark. Usually an archive can be extracted simply by right-clicking on it in KDE.</p>

<p id="s12-1_window-man"><strong>window manager:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A component of a desktop environment that provides the basic
maximize/minimize/close/move functions for windows in the GUI environment. Sometimes it can be used as an alternative to a full desktop environment. In MEPIS, the default window manager is called KWin, and is an integral part of the K Desktop Environment (KDE). In antiX, the default is Fluxbox,  a very light windows manager that requires very little graphics and system RAM.</p>

<p id="s12-1_unix"><strong>Unix:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>UNIX.</em> The operating system which Linux is modeled after, developed in the late 1960's at Bell Labs and used primarily for servers and mainframes. Like Linux, Unix has many variations. </p>

<p id="s12-1_x11"><strong>X:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>X11, xorg.</em> The X Window System is a networking and display protocol which provides windowing on bitmap displays. It provides the standard toolkit and protocol to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Unix-like operating systems and OpenVMS, and is supported by almost all other modern operating systems. In Mepis Linux, the X server operates on <a  class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_runlevel ">runlevel</a> 5. See also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager ">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager</a>
